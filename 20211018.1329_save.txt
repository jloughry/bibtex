    vaccine hesitancy in {US} adults: {January--May} 2021},
  author = {King, Wendy C and Rubinstein, Max and Reinhart, Alex
    and Mejia, Robin J.},
  doi = {10.1101/2021.07.20.21260795},
  abstract = {\textbf{Importance} COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has become a
    leading barrier to increasing the US vaccination rate.

    \textbf{Objective} To evaluate time trends in COVID-19 vaccine intent
    during the US vaccine rollout, and identify key factors related to and
    self-reported reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in May 2021.

    \textbf{Design, Participants and Setting} A COVID-19 survey was offered to
    US adult Facebook users in several languages yielding 5,088,772 qualifying
    responses from January 6 to May 31, 2021. Data was aggregated by month.
    Survey weights matched the sample to the age, gender, and state profile of
    the US population.

    \textbf{Exposure} Demographics, geographic factors, political/COVID-19
    environment, health status, beliefs, and behaviors.

    \textbf{Main Outcome Measures} ``If a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 were
    offered to you today, would you choose to get vaccinated.'' Hesitant was
    defined as responding, probably or definitely would not choose to get
    vaccinated (versus probably or definitely would, or already vaccinated).

    \textbf{Results} COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreased by one-third from
    25.4\% (95\%CI, 25.3, 25.5) in January to 16.6\% (95\%CI, 16.4, 16.7) in
    May, with relatively large decreases among participants with Black, Pacific
    Islander or Hispanic race/ethnicity and $\le$ high school education.
    Independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy in May ($N=525,644$)
    included younger age, non-Asian race, $<4$ year college degree, living in a
    more rural county, living in a county with higher Trump vote share in the
    2020 election, lack of worry about COVID-19, working outside the home,
    never intentionally avoiding contact with others, and no past-year flu
    vaccine. Differences in hesitancy by race/ethnicity varied by age (e.g.,
    Black adults more hesitant than White adults $<35$ years old, but less
    hesitant among adults $\ge$45 years old), and vice versa. Almost half of
    vaccine hesitant respondents reported fear of side effects (49.2\% [95\%CI,
    48.7, 49.7]) and not trusting the COVID-19 vaccine (48.4\% [95\%CI, 48.0,
    48.9]); over one-third reported not trusting the government, not needing
    the vaccine, and waiting to see if safe. Reasons differed by degree of
    vaccine intent and by race/ethnicity.

    Conclusion COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy varied by demographics, geography,
    beliefs, and behaviors, indicating a need for a range of messaging and
    policy options to target high-hesitancy groups.},

  title = {{DoubleStar}: Long-Range Attack Towards Depth Estimation based
    Obstacle Avoidance in Autonomous Systems},
  author = {Zhou, Ce and Yan, Qiben and Shi, Yan and Sun, Lichao},
  abstract = {Depth estimation-based obstacle avoidance has been widely
    adopted by autonomous systems (drones and vehicles) for safety purpose. It
    normally relies on a stereo camera to automatically detect obstacles and
    make flying/driving decisions, e.g., stopping several meters ahead of the
    obstacle in the path or moving away from the detected obstacle. In this
    paper, we explore new security risks associated with the stereo
    vision-based depth estimation algorithms used for obstacle avoidance. By
    exploiting the weaknesses of the stereo matching in depth estimation
    algorithms and the lens flare effect in optical imaging, we propose
    DoubleStar, a long-range attack that injects fake obstacle depth by
    projecting pure light from two complementary light sources.

    DoubleStar includes two distinctive attack formats: beams attack and orbs
    attack, which leverage projected light beams and lens flare orbs
    respectively to cause false depth perception. We successfully attack two
    commercial stereo cameras designed for autonomous systems (ZED and Intel
    RealSense). The visualization of fake depth perceived by the stereo cameras
    illustrates the false stereo matching induced by DoubleStar. We further use
    Ardupilot to simulate the attack and demonstrate its impact on drones. To
    validate the attack on real systems, we perform a real-world attack towards
    a commercial drone equipped with state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance
    algorithms. Our attack can continuously bring a flying drone to a sudden
    stop or drift it away across a long distance under various lighting
    conditions, even bypassing sensor fusion mechanisms. Specifically, our
    experimental results show that DoubleStar creates fake depth up to 15
    meters in distance at night and up to 8 meters during the daytime. To
    mitigate this newly discovered threat, we provide discussions on potential
    countermeasures to defend against DoubleStar.},
