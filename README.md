Consolidated BibTeX File
------------------------

I keep one BibTeX file with everything in it, unless to deliver a paper in LaTeX
source form I need to send it with a cut-down BibTeX file containing only the
necessary bits.

### Changes
Edit the single version here.  The latest will be copied from here by whatever
LaTeX file needs it, when it is needed.  The cannonical version is maintained
here under version control.
