	title = {Decentralized Anonymous Credentials},
	month = {October 15,},
	year = 2013,
	abstract = {Anonymous credentials provide a powerful tool for making\
		assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation\
		of today's anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted\
		credential issuer---which is both a single point of failure and a target\
		for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make\
		it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in\
		the {\it ad hoc} network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks)\
		where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility.  In this work\
		we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need\
		for a trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in\
		the area of electronic cash and uses techniques---such as the calculation\
		of a distributed transaction ledger---that are currently in widespread\
		deployment in the Bitcoin payment system. Using this decentralized ledger\
		and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of\
		security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make\
		flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees. Finally, we\
		discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including\
		resource management in {\it ad hoc} networks and prevention of Sybil attacks.\
		We implement our scheme and measure its efficiency.},

		discarded by compiler optimizations due to undefined

		in many systems, including the Linux kernel and the Postgres
		database. The consequences of unstable code range
		from incorrect functionality to missing security checks.
		To reason about unstable code, this paper proposes
		a novel model, which views unstable code in terms of
		optimizations that leverage undefined behavior. Using
		this model, we introduce a new static checker called \textsc{Stack}
		that precisely identifies unstable code. Applying \textsc{Stack}
		to widely used systems has uncovered 160 new bugs that
		have been confirmed and fixed by developers.},

		Toward this end, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 17\
		proteomics researchers who interact with data from ProteomeCommons.org, a\

		that provenance does help end-users gauge the trustworthiness of data and\

		accompanied by other kinds of information, including: more specific data\
		quality information, the data itself, and author reputation information.\

		This paper presents a hypervisor-based design that enables a trusted path to bypass\
		an untrusted operating-system, applications, and I/O devices, with a minimal Trusted\
		Computing Base (TCB). We also suggest concrete I/O architectural changes that will\
		simplify future trusted-path system design. Our system enables users to verify the\
		states and configurations of one or more trusted-paths using a simple, secret-less,\

	successfully dispatching any instructions. The ``hard-wired'' logic of handling these\
	faults is used to perform arithmetic and logic primitives, as well as memory reads and\

		sizes for the largest global firms follows a Pareto distribution in an intermediate\
		range that is ``interrupted'' by a sharp cutoff in its upper tail, which is totally\
		dominated by financial firms. This contrasts with a large body of empirical\
		literature which finds a Pareto distribution for firm sizes both across countries\
		and over time. Pareto distributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of\
		proportional random growth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale: this makes\
		our evidence of an ``interrupted'' Pareto distribution all the more puzzling, because\
		we provide evidence that financial firms in our sample operate in such a regime. We\
		claim that the missing mass from the upper tail of the asset size distribution is a\
		consequence of shadow banking activity and that it provides an estimate of the size of\
		the shadow banking system. This estimate---that we propose as a shadow banking\
		index---compares well with estimates of the Financial Stability Board until 2009, but\
		it shows a sharper rise in shadow banking activity after 2010.},

		in \emph{Fancc}-deficient mice. FANCC-deficient macrophages are\
		also hypersensitive to TLR activation and produce TNF$\alpha$ in an\
		unrestrained fashion. Reasoning that suppression of inhibitory\
		cytokine production might enhance hematopoiesis, we screened small\
		molecules using TLR agonist--stimulated FANCC- and Fanconi anemia,\
		complementation group A (FANCA)--deficient macrophages containing\
		an NF-$\kappa$B/AP-1--responsive reporter gene (\emph{SEAP}). Of the 75 small\
		molecules screened, the p38 MAPK inhibitor BIRB 796 and dasatinib\
		potently suppressed TLR8-dependent expression of the reporter\
		gene. Fanconi anemia (FA) macrophages were hypersensitive to the\
		TLR7/8 activator R848, overproducing SEAP and TNF$\alpha$ in response\
		to all doses of the agonist. Low doses (50nM) of both agents\
		inhibited p38 MAPK--dependent activation of MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and\
		suppressed MK2-dependent TNF$\alpha$ production without substantially\
		influencing TNF$\alpha$ gene transcription. Overproduction of TNF$\alpha$\
		by primary FA cells was likewise suppressed by these agents\
		and involved inhibition of MK2 activation. Because MK2 is also\
		known to influence production and/or sensitivity to 2 other\
		suppressive factors (MIP-1$\alpha$ and IFN$\gamma$) to which FA hematopoietic\
		progenitor cells are uniquely vulnerable, targeting of p38 MAPK\
		in FA hematopoietic cells is a rational objective for preclinical evaluation.},

	abstract = {(Moore's Law applied to the complexity of life from mammals to fish to worms to\
		eukaryotes to prokaryotes to zero suggests that life's complexity began around\
		$9.7\pm 2.5$ billion years ago. The doubling time in this case is 376 million years.)\
		An extrapolation of the genetic complexity of organisms to earlier times suggests that\
		life began before the Earth was formed. Life may have started from systems with single\
		heritable elements that are functionally equivalent to a nucleotide. The genetic\
		complexity, roughly measured by the number of non-redundant functional nucleotides, is\
		expected to have grown exponentially due to several positive feedback factors: gene\
		cooperation, duplication of genes with their subsequent specialization, and emergence\
		of novel functional niches associated with existing genes. Linear regression of genetic\
		complexity on a log scale extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests the time of\
		the origin of life 9.7 billion years ago. This cosmic time scale for the evolution of\
		life has important consequences: life took ca. 5 billion years to reach the complexity\
		of bacteria; the environments in which life originated and evolved to the prokaryote\
		stage may have been quite different from those envisaged on Earth; there was no\
		intelligent life in our universe prior to the origin of Earth, thus Earth could not have\
		been deliberately seeded with life by intelligent aliens; Earth was seeded by panspermia;\
		experimental replication of the origin of life from scratch may have to emulate many\
		cumulative rare events; and the Drake equation for guesstimating the number of\
		civilizations in the universe is likely wrong, as intelligent life has just begun\
		appearing in our universe. Evolution of advanced organisms has accelerated via\
		development of additional information-processing systems: epigenetic memory, primitive\
		mind, multicellular brain, language, books, computers, and Internet. As a result the\
		doubling time of complexity has reached ca. 20 years. Finally, we discuss the issue of\
		the predicted technological singularity and give a biosemiotics perspective on the\
		increase of complexity.},

		our method, tiny crystals of porous complexes are soaked in a solution of the target,\
		such that the complexes can absorb the target molecules. Crystallographic analysis\
		clearly determines the absorbed guest structures along with the host frameworks.\
		Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one tiny crystal of the complex, the\
		required sample mass is of the nanogram gram order. We demonstrate that as little as\
		about 80 nanograms of a sample is enough for the SCD analysis. In combination with\
		high-performance liquid chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization\
		of multiple fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography SCD\
		analysis. Furthermore, we unambiguously determined the structure of a scarce marine\
		natural product using only 5 micrograms of the compound.},

		where the key under which encryption and decryption are performed is itself derived\
		from the message. MLE provides a way to achieve secure de-duplication (space-efficient\
		secure outsourced storage), a goal currently targeted by numerous cloud-storage\
		providers. We provide definitions both for privacy and for a form of integrity that\
		we call tag consistency. Based on this foundation, we make both practical and\
		theoretical contributions. On the practical side, we provide ROM [(Random Oracle Model)]\
		security analyses of a natural family of MLE schemes that includes deployed schemes. On\
		the theoretical side the challenge is standard model solutions, and we make connections\
		with deterministic encryption, hash functions secure on correlated inputs and the\
		sample-then-extract paradigm to deliver schemes under different assumptions and for\
		different classes of message sources. Our work shows that MLE is a primitive of both\
		practical and theoretical interest.},

	abstract = {The difficulty of cross domain systems security accreditation lies inherent in\
		the fact that, by definition, such systems always span at least one boundary between\
		security domains controlled by different data owners. Consequently, approved solutions\
		regularly encounter security testing criteria that represent the duplicated\
		responsibility for residual risk of multiple security accreditors. Each data owner\
		perceives a site-specific set of risks that would be desirable to mitigate, a\
		technology-dependent set of risks that it is possible to mitigate, and a residual risk\
		it is felt acceptable not to mitigate. Time and cost inefficiency in cross domain\
		system accreditation are shown to originate from asymmetry of knowledge; Spence's\
		criteria for market signalling are shown to hold by analogy for accreditor--accreditor\
		communication in the presence of unequal or non-hierarchical security clearances. By\
		formalising signals, an efficient route to agreement about the true level of residual\
		risk might avoid repeated re-testing and redundant risk mitigations. If successful,\
		the unnecessarily high cost of duplicated security test and evaluation effort could be\
		greatly reduced.},

		collected by Google, Inc. in 2006, the CLOAK system automatically flags candidate words,\
		phrases, sentences, and paragraphs in documents under review that are likely classified\
		and suggests redactions to make the document unclassified. Security classification\
		guidance from more than one guide at a time is figured into each suggested redaction.\
		The probabilistic aspect of operation is in the way the system prioritizes its\
		suggestions according to the measured rate of occurrence of words and phrases observed\
		in the language's current usage, avoiding low likelihood phrases in favor of more\
		probable interpretations. Collocation correlation of phrases in security\
		classification guides has automatically discovered missing, incomplete, and inconsistent\
		rules in existing security classification guides, promoting forward quality improvement\
		of security classification guides. Performance from the earliest prototype software,\
		implemented in Perl using associative arrays, was surprisingly acceptable and suggests\
		that an alternative network representation, to be implemented using the map-reduce\
		algorithm on a high performance cluster, would have improved capacity, depth, accuracy,\

		by nanoscale arrays of melanin-containing organelles (melanosomes). Data relevant to the\
		evolution of these colors and the properties of melanosomes involved in their generation\
		have been limited. A data set sampling variables of extant avian melanosomes reveals that\
		those forming most iridescent arrays are distinctly narrow. Quantitative comparison of\
		these data with melanosome imprints densely sampled from a previously unknown specimen of\
		the Early Cretaceous feathered \emph{Microraptor} predicts that its plumage was\
		predominantly iridescent. The capacity for simple iridescent arrays is thus minimally\
		inferred in paravian dinosaurs. This finding and estimation of \emph{Microraptor}\
		feathering consistent with an ornamental function for the tail suggest a centrality for\
		signaling in early evolution of plumage and feather color.},

	concerns of being able to oversee the actual compliance. As Common Criteria is formulated\
	today it is unlikely that it would survive over time. The reasons why it might fail is the\
	rigid framework, rapid technical development makes a security target a moving target\

		according to the measured rate of occurrence of words and phrases observed in the\

		classification guides, promoting forward quality improvement of security classification\
		guides. Performance from the earliest prototype software, implemented in Perl using\

		cryptography. It aims to address a practical security problem: how to establish secure\
		communication between two parties solely based on a shared password without requiring a\
		Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). After more than a decade of extensive research in this\
		field, there have been several PAKE protocols available. The EKE and SPEKE schemes are\
		perhaps the two most notable examples. Both techniques are however patented. In this\
		paper, we review these techniques in detail and summarize various theoretical and\
		practical weaknesses. In addition, we present a new PAKE solution called J-PAKE. Our\
		strategy is to depend on well-established primitives such as the Zero-Knowledge Proof\
		(ZKP). So far, almost all of the past solutions have avoided using ZKP for the concern\
		on efficiency. We demonstrate how to effectively integrate the ZKP into the protocol\
		design and meanwhile achieve good efficiency. Our protocol has comparable computational\
		efficiency to the EKE and SPEKE schemes with clear advantages on security.},

		outlines what would constitute cyber war: a potentially lethal, instrumental, and\
		political act of force conducted through malicious code. The second part shows what\
		cyber war is not, case-by-case. Not one single cyber offense on record constitutes an\
		act of war on its own. The final part offers a more nuanced terminology to come to terms\
		with cyber attacks. All politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated\
		versions of three activities that are as old as warfare itself: sabotage, espionage, and\
		subversion.},

		whether this release is safe: is it possible that the attacker compromises the\
		information release mechanism and extracts more secret information than intended? While\
		the security community has recognised the importance of the problem, the\
		state-of-the-art in information release is, unfortunately, a number of approaches with\
		somewhat unconnected semantic goals. We provide a road map of the main directions of\
		current research, by classifying the basic goals according to what information is\
		released, who releases information, where in the system information is released and when\
		information can be released. With a general declassification framework as a long-term\
		goal, we identify some prudent principles of declassification. These principles shed\
		light on existing definitions and may also serve as useful `sanity checks' for emerging\
		models.},

		errors in security-typed programs, enabling legacy code to be retrofit with comprehensive\
		security policy mediation. Resolving such type errors requires selecting a placement of\
		\emph{mediation statements} that implement runtime security decisions, such as\
		declassifiers and authorization checks. Manually placing mediation statements in legacy\
		code can be difficult, as there may be several, interacting type errors. In this paper,\
		we solve this problem by constructing a graph that has the property that a vertex cut is\
		equivalent to the points at which mediation statements can be inserted to allow the\
		program to satisfy the type system. We build a framework that produces \emph{suggestions}\
		that are minimum cuts of this graph, and the framework can be customized to find\
		suggestions that satisfy programmer requirements. Our framework implementation for Java\
		programs computes suggestions for 20,000 line programs in less than 100 seconds, reduces\
		the number of locations a programmer must consider by 90\%, and selects suggestions\
		similar to those proposed by expert programmers 80\% of the time.\

		merely a question of management style or personal preference. In the legal environment\
		that has developed around publicly traded corporations, managers are strongly discouraged\
		from shouldering any risks that they know about---or, in the opinion of some future jury,\
		should have known about---even if they have a hunch that the gamble might pay off in the\
		long run. There is no such thing as long run in industries driven by the next quarterly\
		report. The possibility of some innovation making money is just that mere possibility\
		that will not have time to materialize before the subpoenas from minority shareholder\
		lawsuits begin to roll in.

	abstract = {Three hypotheses have attempted to explain the phenomenon of contagious\
		yawning. It has been hypothesized that it is a fixed action pattern for which the\
		releasing stimulus is the observation of another yawn, that it is the result of\
		non-conscious mimicry emerging through close links between perception and action or that\
		it is the result of empathy, involving the ability to engage in mental state attribution.\
		This set of experiments sought to distinguish between these hypotheses by examining\
		contagious yawning in a species that is unlikely to show nonconscious mimicry and empathy\
		but does respond to social stimuli: the red-footed tortoise Geochelone carbonaria. A\
		demonstrator tortoise was conditioned to yawn when presented with a red square-shaped\
		stimulus. Observer tortoises were exposed to three conditions: observation of conditioned\
		yawn, non demonstration control, and stimulus only control. We measured the number of\
		yawns for each observer animal in each condition. There was no difference between\
		conditions. Experiment 2 therefore increased the number of conditioned yawns presented.\
		Again, there was no significant difference between conditions. It seemed plausible that\
		the tortoises did not view the conditioned yawn as a real yawn and therefore a final\
		experiment was run using video recorded stimuli. The observer tortoises were presented\
		with three conditions: real yawn, conditioned yawns and empty background. Again there was\
		no significant difference between conditions. We therefore conclude that the red-footed\
		tortoise does not yawn in response to observing a conspecific yawn. This suggests that\
		contagious yawning is not the result of a fixed action pattern but may involve more\
		complex social processes},

		reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking\
		journals (\emph{Science}, \emph{Nature}, \emph{Nature Neuroscience}, \emph{Neuron}, and\
		\emph{The Journal of Neuroscience}) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79\

		feet. The use of a test window seat which does not simulate the hull strains is\
		satisfactory for window test. It is recommended that the conical window seat be extended\
		inward beyond the window to allow for normal elastic extrusion. Plexiglas windows are\
		susceptible to collision damage due to brittleness and low strength of the material. An\

		analogue of aerodynamic lift, in which a cambered\
		refractive object with differently shaped top and\
		bottom surfaces experiences a transverse lift force\
		when placed in a uniform stream of light. A\
		semi-cylindrical rod is found to automatically\
		torque into a stable angle of attack, and then\
		exhibit uniform motion. We have experimentally\
		verified this using a micrometer-scale lightfoil\
		which was fabricated using photolithographic\
		techniques, immersed in water and illuminated with\
		milliwatt-scale laser light. Unlike optical tweezers,\
		an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a\
		transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted\
		simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of\
		light. We propose using optical lift to power\
		micromachines, transport microscopic particles in\
		a liquid, or to improve the design of solar sails\
		for interstellar space travel.\

		for privacy-sensitive tasks, becoming highly valuable\
		targets for attackers. They are also quite different\
		from PCs, so that PC-oriented solutions are not always\
		applicable, or do not offer comprehensive security. We\
		propose an alternative solution, where security checks\
		are applied on remote \emph{security servers} that\
		host exact \emph{replicas} of the phones in virtual\
		environments. The servers are not subject to the\
		same constraints, allowing us to apply \emph{multiple}\
		detection techniques \emph{simultaneously}. We implemented\
		a prototype of this security model for Android phones, and\
		show that it is both practical and scalable: we generate\
		no more than 2KiB/s and 64B/s of trace data for high-loads\
		and idle operation respectively, and are able to support\
		more than a hundred replicas running on a single server.

	abstract = {Side channel attacks on cryptographic systems are\
		attacks exploiting information gained from physical\
		implementations rather than utilizing theoretical\
		weaknesses of a scheme. In particular, during the last\
		years, major achievements were made for the class of\
		access-driven cache-attacks. The source of information\
		leakage for such attacks are the locations of memory\
		accesses performed by a victim process.\
\
		In this paper we analyze the case of AES and present an\
		attack which is capable of recovering the full secret key\
		in almost realtime for AES-128, requiring only a very\
		limited number of observed encryptions. Unlike most other\
		attacks, ours neither needs to know the ciphertext, nor\
		does it need to know any information about the plaintext\
		(such as its distribution, etc.). Moreover, for the first\
		time we also show how the plaintext can be recovered\
		without having access to the ciphertext. Further, our\
		spy process can be run under an unprivileged user account.\
		It is the first working attack for implementations using\
		compressed tables, where it is not possible to find\
		out the beginning of AES rounds any more -- a corner\
		stone for all efficient previous attacks. All results\
		of our attack have been demonstrated by a fully working\
		implementation, and do not solely rely on theoretical\
		considerations or simulations.\
\
		A contribution of probably independent interest is a denial\
		of service attack on the scheduler of current Linux\
		systems (CFS), which allows to monitor memory accesses\
		with novelly high precision. Finally, we give some\
		generalizations of our attack, and suggest some possible\
		countermeasures which would render our attack impossible.\

	abstract = {This paper examines the limits of accuracy in reporting\
		isolated product yields (i.e., recovery of total mass from chromatography\
		or extractions) as well as ratios of isomers determined by HPLC,\
		GC, or NMR methods. Attention is directed to the magnitude of errors\
		encountered in the HPLC or GC measurements of such ratios when these\
		measurements are conducted without accurate calibrations or determinations\
		of response factors for the particular isomers. Accurately defined\
		mixtures of compounds (prepared by volumetric means) were examined\
		by the above methods and the obtained measurements compared with the\
		actual composition. The relative errors between actual content and the\
		measured values are listed for all comparisons. In addition, accuracy\
		in the determination of weight of a sample as a function of scale was\
		also examined. The results are tabulated for comparison and suggestions\
		are made to the reader as to how to avoid inaccurate reporting of\
		experimental parameters. The authors hope that disclosure of these facts\
		will result in new editorial policies requiring that a phrase dr or er\
		ratios reported in this paper have not been validated by calibration'\
		be inserted into general experimental descriptions. In addition, such\
		editorial policy should also discourage the use of terms de' and ee',\
		as these descriptors do not provide accurate and meaningful information\
		about stereoisomer composition. This latter issue has already been\
		suggested in the literature on several occasions.},

		to reduce time and cost wasted on unnecessary retesting of the same or similar\
		security requirements during security test and evaluation in multi-level environments.\

		Assurance Separation Kernel PP does not even correspond to an EAL at all; CC has not\

		semi-formal; there is an `abstraction gap' between the requirements placed on a TOE\
		and the requirements placed on a PP especially at higher EALs (see graph) although\
		the abstraction gap is present at all EALs; the authors propose goal-based assurance\
		rather than standards-based assurance, as at present in the CC; proposed CC\
		enhancements: EAL~X; they want to close the abstraction gap between TOE and PP at\
		EAL~X by requiring more formality in the PP.},

		manifold and sometimes contradictory meanings. There is no\
		immediate problem when trust is used in a specific research area\
		to denote some concept of interest. Difficulties arise when\
		interfacing between communities that use this word differently,\
		and with the general public which is unlikely to associate a word\
		like trust with any specific technical definition adopted in a\

		status indicators on data communication equipment, under certain conditions, are shown\
		to carry a modulated optical signal that is significantly correlated with information\
		being processed by the device. Physical access is not required; the attacker gains\
		access to all data going through the device, including plaintext in the case of data\
		encryption systems. Experiments show that it is possible to intercept data under\
		realistic conditions at a considerable distance. Many different sorts of devices,\
		including modems and Internet Protocol routers, were found to be vulnerable. A taxonomy\
		of compromising optical emanations is developed, and design changes are described that\
		will successfully block this kind of "Optical Tempest" attack.\
