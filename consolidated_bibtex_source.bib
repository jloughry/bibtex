  abstract = {With the growing processing power of computing systems and the
    increasing availability of massive datasets, machine learning algorithms
    have led to major breakthroughs in many different areas. This development
    has influenced computer security, spawning a series of work on
    learning-based security systems, such as for malware detection,
    vulnerability discovery, and binary code analysis. Despite great potential,
    machine learning in security is prone to subtle pitfalls that undermine its
    performance and render learning-based systems potentially unsuitable for
    security tasks and practical deployment. In this paper, we look at this
    problem with critical eyes. First, we identify common pitfalls in the
    design, implementation, and evaluation of learning-based security systems.
    We conduct a study of 30 papers from top-tier security conferences within
    the past 10 years, confirming that these pitfalls are widespread in the
    current security literature. In an empirical analysis, we further
    demonstrate how individual pitfalls can lead to unrealistic performance and
    interpretations, obstructing the understanding of the security problem at
    hand. As a remedy, we propose actionable recommendations to support
    researchers in avoiding or mitigating the pitfalls where possible.
    Furthermore, we identify open problems when applying machine learning in
    security and provide directions for further research.},

  author = {K\"{o}hler, Sebastian and Lovisotto, Giulio and Birnbach, Simon

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe how the electronic rolling shutter in
    CMOS image sensors can be exploited using a bright, modulated light source
    (e.g., an inexpensive, off-the-shelf laser), to inject fine-grained image
    disruptions. We demonstrate the attack on seven different CMOS cameras,
    ranging from cheap IoT to semi-professional surveillance cameras, to
    highlight the wide applicability of the rolling shutter attack. We model
    the fundamental factors affecting a rolling shutter attack in an
    uncontrolled setting. We then perform an exhaustive evaluation of the
    attack's effect on the task of object detection, investigating the effect
    of attack parameters. We validate our model against empirical data
    collected on two separate cameras, showing that by simply using information
    from the camera's datasheet the adversary can accurately predict the
    injected distortion size and optimize their attack accordingly. We find
    that an adversary can hide up to 75\% of objects perceived by
    state-of-the-art detectors by selecting appropriate attack parameters. We
    also investigate the stealthiness of the attack in comparison to a naïve
    camera blinding attack, showing that common image distortion metrics can
    not detect the attack presence. Therefore, we present a new, accurate and
    lightweight enhancement to the backbone network of an object detector to
    recognize rolling shutter attacks. Overall, our results indicate that
    rolling shutter attacks can substantially reduce the performance and
    reliability of vision-based intelligent systems.},

    levels of security support, it is critically important to consider security
    aspects while selecting programming languages for developing software
    systems. Inadequate consideration of security in the choice of a
    programming language may lead to potential ramifications for secure
    development. Whilst theoretical analysis of the supposed security
    properties of different programming languages has been conducted, there has
    been relatively little effort to empirically explore the actual security
    challenges experienced by developers. We have performed a large-scale study
    of the security challenges of 15 programming languages by quantitatively
    and qualitatively analysing the developers' discussions from Stack Overflow
    and GitHub. By leveraging topic modelling, we have derived a taxonomy of 18
    major security challenges for 6 topic categories. We have also conducted
    comparative analysis to understand how the identified challenges vary
    regarding the different programming languages and data sources. Our
    findings suggest that the challenges and their characteristics differ
    substantially for different programming languages and data sources, i.e.,
    Stack Overflow and GitHub. The findings provide evidence-based insights and
    understanding of security challenges related to different programming
    languages to software professionals (i.e., practitioners or researchers).
    The reported taxonomy of security challenges can assist both practitioners
    and researchers in better understanding and traversing the secure
    development landscape. This study highlights the importance of the choice
    of technology, e.g., programming language, in secure software engineering.
    Hence, the findings are expected to motivate practitioners to consider the
    potential impact of the choice of programming languages on software
    security.},

    Recognition Models},

  abstract = {Deep learning-based facial recognition (FR) models have
    demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the past few years, even when
    wearing protective medical face masks became commonplace during the
    COVID-19 pandemic. Given the outstanding performance of these models, the
    machine learning research community has shown increasing interest in
    challenging their robustness. Initially, researchers presented adversarial
    attacks in the digital domain, and later the attacks were transferred to
    the physical domain. However, in many cases, attacks in the physical domain
    are conspicuous, requiring, for example, the placement of a sticker on the
    face, and thus may raise suspicion in real-world environments (e.g.,
    airports). In this paper, we propose Adversarial Mask, a physical
    adversarial universal perturbation (UAP) against state-of-the-art FR models
    that is applied on face masks in the form of a carefully crafted pattern.
    In our experiments, we examined the transferability of our adversarial mask
    to a wide range of FR model architectures and datasets. In addition, we
    validated our adversarial mask effectiveness in real-world experiments by
    printing the adversarial pattern on a fabric medical face mask, causing the
    FR system to identify only 3.34\% of the participants wearing the mask
    (compared to a minimum of 83.34\% with other evaluated masks).},

    environment to alter animal behavior and physiology. Despite progress in
    understanding how different stimuli are represented by changes in neuronal
    activity, less is known about how they affect broader neural network
    properties. We developed a framework for using graph-theoretic features of
    neural network activity to predict ecologically relevant stimulus
    properties, in particular stimulus identity. We used the transparent
    nematode, {\it Caenorhabditis elegans}, with its small nervous system to
    define neural network features associated with various chemosensory
    stimuli. We first immobilized animals using a microfluidic device and
    exposed their noses to chemical stimuli while monitoring changes in neural
    activity of more than 50 neurons in the head region. We found that
    graph-theoretic features, which capture patterns of interactions between
    neurons, are modulated by stimulus identity. Further, we show that a simple
    machine learning classifier trained using graph-theoretic features alone,
    or in combination with neural activity features, can accurately predict
    salt stimulus. Moreover, by focusing on putative causal interactions
    between neurons, the graph-theoretic features were almost twice as
    predictive as the neural activity features. These results reveal that
    stimulus identity modulates the broad, network-level organization of the
    nervous system, and that graph theory can be used to characterize these
    changes.},

    consumed drugs in the USA. Recent research has suggested that
    acetaminophen’s effects extend to the blunting of negative as well as
    positive affect. Because affect is a determinant of risk perception and
    risk taking, we tested the hypothesis that acute acetaminophen consumption
    (1000 mg) could influence these important judgments and decisions. In three
    double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, healthy young adults completed a
    laboratory measure of risk taking (Balloon Analog Risk Task) and in Studies
    1 and 2 completed self-report measures of risk perception. Across all
    studies (total $n = 545$), acetaminophen increased risk-taking behavior. On
    the more affectively stimulating risk perception measure used in Study 2,
    acetaminophen reduced self-reported perceived risk and this reduction
    statistically mediated increased risk-taking behavior. These results
    indicate that acetaminophen can increase risk taking, which may be due to
    reductions in risk perceptions, particularly those that are highly affect
    laden.},

    a real-time measure of `revealed' distress and mental health concerns
    across a range of topics4–9. We collected data on 8 million calls from 19
    countries, focusing on the COVID-19 crisis. Call volumes peaked six weeks
    after the initial outbreak, at 35\% above pre-pandemic levels. The increase
    was driven mainly by fear (including fear of infection), loneliness and,
    later in the pandemic, concerns about physical health. Relationship issues,
    economic problems, violence and suicidal ideation, however, were less
    prevalent than before the pandemic. This pattern was apparent both during
    the first wave and during subsequent COVID-19 waves. Issues linked directly
    to the pandemic therefore seem to have replaced rather than exacerbated
    underlying anxieties. Conditional on infection rates, suicide-related calls
    increased when containment policies became more stringent and decreased
    when income support was extended. This implies that financial relief can
    allay the distress triggered by lockdown measures and illustrates the
    insights that can be gleaned from the statistical analysis of helpline

    environment by moving a physically actuated machine resulting in a change
    to the channel response that is measurable by a distant receiver capable of
    collecting CSI samples. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate data when
    transmission using conventional methods is impossible, yet the attacker
    controls a moving mechanism. We discuss the design of the covert channel in
    detail and produce a proof of concept implementation to evaluate the
    performance in terms of communication quality. We find that even a simple
    implementation provides robust communication in an office environment.

    Users that do keyword searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the

  abstract = {Adulteration is a growing food safety concern worldwide. Previous
    studies have implicated turmeric as a source of lead (\ce{Pb}) exposure due
    to the addition of lead chromate (\ce{PbCrO4}), a yellow pigment used to
    enhance brightness. We aimed to assess the practice of adding yellow
    pigments to turmeric and producer- consumer- and regulatory-factors
    affecting this practice across the supply chain in Bangladesh. We
    identified and visited the nine major turmeric-producing districts of
    Bangladesh as well as two districts with minimal turmeric production. In
    each district, we conducted semi-structured interviews and informal
    observations with individuals involved in the production, consumption, and
    regulation of turmeric. We explored perceptions of and preferences for
    turmeric quality. We collected samples of yellow pigments and turmeric from
    the most-frequented wholesale and retail markets. We collected samples of
    turmeric, pigments, dust, and soil from turmeric polishing mills to assess
    evidence of adulteration. Interviews were analyzed through an inductive,
    thematic coding process, with attention focused on perceptions of and
    preferences for turmeric quality. Samples were analyzed for \ce{Pb} and
    chromium (\ce{Cr}) concentrations via inductively coupled plasma mass
    spectrometry and x-ray fluorescence. In total, we interviewed 152
    individuals from across the supply chain and collected 524 samples of
    turmeric, pigments, dust, and soil (Table S3, Table S4). Turmeric Pb and Cr
    concentrations were highest in Dhaka and Munshiganj districts, with maximum
    turmeric powder \ce{Pb} concentrations of \SI{1152}{\micro\gram\per\gram},
    compared to \SI{690}{\micro\gram\per\gram}  in the 9 major
    turmeric-producing districts. We found evidence of \ce{PbCrO4}-based yellow
    pigment adulteration in 7 of the 9 major turmeric-producing districts. Soil
    samples from polishing mills contained a maximum of
    \SI{4257}{\micro\gram\per\gram} \ce{Pb} and yellow pigments contained
    2--10\% \ce{Pb} by weight with an average \ce{Pb}:\ce{Cr} molar ratio of
    1.3. Turmeric wholesalers reported that the practice of adding yellow
    pigments to dried turmeric root during polishing began more than 30 years
    ago and continues today, primarily driven by consumer preferences for
    colorful yellow curries. Farmers stated that merchants are able to sell
    otherwise poor-quality roots and increase their profits by asking polishers
    to adulterate with yellow pigments. Adulterating turmeric with lead
    chromate poses significant risks to human health and development. The
    results from this study indicate that \ce{PbCrO4} is being added to
    turmeric by polishers, who are unaware of its neurotoxic effects, in order
    to satisfy wholesalers who are driven by consumer demand for yellow roots.
    We recommend immediate intervention that engages turmeric producers and
    consumers to address this public health crisis and ensure a future with
    \ce{Pb}-free turmeric.},

    central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), in-game currencies, and quantum

    determinants of the monetary equilibrium that emerges in the forthcoming
    era of heightened currency competition. This paper makes the first

    related to mobility, security, and connectivity. The current solutions used
    to deal with these problems have limitations and they usually require a lot
    of resources with suboptimal results. In this paper, we proposed an
    aerial-based solution that rely on Networked Tethered Flying Platforms
    (NTFPs). NTFPs are flying vehicles such as drones, Helikites, and blimps,
    that are tethered to the ground via a cable that supplies them with
    constant data and power. NTFPs can fly at high altitude with a great
    backhaul capacity and large coverage. We show in this paper how NTFP-based
    solution solve mobility, security, and connectivity problems during the
    Hajj and the main advantages and benefits as well as the cost-efficiency of
    such solution. For the sake of completeness, we also present other similar
    case studies in which NTFPs can be used.},

  title = {Proofs of Useless Work---Positive and Negative Results for Wasteless
    Mining Systems},
  author = {Dotan, Maya and Tochner, Saar},
  abstract = {Many blockchain systems today, including Bitcoin, rely on Proof
    of Work (PoW). Proof of work is crucial to the liveness and security of
    cryptocurrencies. The assumption when using PoW is that a lot of trial and
    error is required on average before a valid block is generated. One of the
    main concerns raised with regard to this kind of system is the inherent
    need to "waste" energy on "meaningless" problems. In fact, the Bitcoin
    system is believed to consume more electricity than several small
    countries.

    In this work we formally define three properties that are necessary for
    wasteless PoW systems: (1) solve ``meaningful'' problems (2) solve them
    efficiently and (3) be secure against double-spend attacks. These
    properties aim to create an open market for problem-solving, in which
    miners produce solutions to problems in the most efficient way (wasteless).
    The security of the system stems from the economical incentive created by
    the demand for solutions to these problems.

    We analyze these properties, and deduce constraints that must apply to such
    PoW systems. In our main result, we conclude that under realistic
    assumptions, the set of allowed problems must be preimage resistant
    functions in order to keep the system secure and efficient.},

    lasers, microwave photonics and photonic computing networks. Yet, among all
    demonstrated functionalities for \ce{Si3N4} integrated photonics, optical
    non-reciprocal devices such as isolators and circulators have not been
    achieved. Conventionally, they are realized based on the Faraday effect of
    magneto-optic materials under an external magnetic field; however, it has
    been challenging to integrate magneto-optic materials that are not
    compatible with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductors and that require
    bulky external magnet. Here we demonstrate a magnetic-free optical isolator
    based on aluminium nitride (\ce{AlN}) piezoelectric modulators
    monolithically integrated on low-loss \ce{Si3N4} PICs. The transmission
    reciprocity is broken by spatio-temporal modulation of a \ce{Si3N4}
    microring resonator with three \ce{AlN} bulk acoustic wave resonators that
    are driven with a rotational phase. This design creates an effective
    rotating acoustic wave that allows indirect interband transition in only
    one direction among a pair of strongly coupled optical modes. A maximum of
    10 dB isolation is achieved under 300 mW total radiofrequency power applied
    to three actuators, with minimum insertion loss of 0.1 dB. An isolation
    bandwidth of 700 MHz is obtained, determined by the optical resonance
    linewidth. The isolation remains constant over nearly 30 dB dynamic range
    of optical input power, showing excellent optical linearity. Our
    integrated, linear, magnetic-free, electrically driven optical isolator
    could be a key building block for integrated lasers and optical interfaces
    for superconducting circuits.},

    between accuracy for a population of interest ("sum query") vs. accuracy
    for its component sub-populations ("point queries"). Compared to
    differentially private query answering systems that are not required to
    produce microdata, accuracy can degrade by a logarithmic factor. For
    example, in the case of pure differential privacy, without the microdata
    requirement, one can provide noisy answers to the sum query and all point
    queries while guaranteeing that each answer has squared error O(1/ϵ2). With
    the microdata requirement, one must choose between allowing an additional
    log2(d) factor (d is the number of point queries) for some point queries or
    allowing an extra O(d2) factor for the sum query. We present lower bounds
    for pure, approximate, and concentrated differential privacy. We propose

  title = {Leaky hardware: modeling and exploiting imperfections in embedded
    devices},
  author = {Giechaskiel, Ilias},
  month = {Trinity},
  abstract = {Embedded systems are found in many safety- and security-critical
    applications, and bring aspects of the physical world to the digital one
    and vice versa. However, imperfections in this hardware bridge can break
    the integrity of sensor inputs into an embedded device, causing it to act
    upon the wrong data. For instance, malicious electromagnetic transmissions
    can trick systems into inducing defibrillation shocks and raising the
    temperature of infant incubators, both with potentially severe health
    consequences.

    Unfortunately, such attacks which alter sensor outputs without changing the
    property being measured itself have so far only been studied in an ad-hoc
    manner. In my thesis, I address this shortcoming in two ways. First, I
    create a taxonomy of these “out-of-band” signal injection attacks and
    defenses. Second, I propose a framework that quantifies security in their
    context through a system model, mathematical definitions, and an algorithm
    that can compare the “security level” of off-the-shelf systems.

    In my thesis, I also investigate Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs),
    which are available on public cloud infrastructures, and are also
    integrated in many consumer end-products, such as smartphones and laptops.
    As FPGAs are often used in sensitive applications, including genome
    processing, cryptography, and financial modeling, it is necessary to ensure
    that they can maintain the secrecy of the data that they process.

    However, the confidentiality of FPGA data can be broken, as I demonstrate
    through three new sources of information leakage due to hardware
    imperfections. The first source exists between “long wires” within seven
    families of Xilinx FPGAs. I explain how to exploit long-wire leakage for
    covert- and side-channel attacks, both locally, and on two commercial FPGA
    clouds through novel ring oscillators structures that bypass
    currently-deployed countermeasures.

    The second source of leakage operates even when different FPGA users are
    isolated to distinct dies of the same chip. These unintended interactions
    demonstrate that current FPGA architectures are not well-suited for
    multi-tenancy, despite the physical isolation of user logic. Finally, I
    show that assigning dedicated FPGAs to different users is still not enough
    to prevent cross-FPGA communication: shared Power Supply Units (PSUs) leak
    information between physically distinct FPGA, CPU, and GPU boards, which
    can be detected via means of a novel receiver design and classification
    metric.

    Overall, in my thesis, I highlight that the underlying electrical
    properties of embedded devices often fall short of protecting the integrity
    and the confidentiality of the data that they process, and allow remote
    attackers to spoof sensor measurements or infer cryptographic keys and
    other types of data.},

  abstract = {In the era of quantum computing, Shor's algorithm running on
    quantum computers (QCs) can break asymmetric encryption algorithms that
    classical computers essentially cannot. QCs, with the help of Grover's
    algorithm, can also speed up the breaking of symmetric encryption
    algorithms. Though the exact date when QCs will become "dangerous" for
    practical problems is unknown, the consensus is that this future is near.
    Thus, one needs to start preparing for the era of quantum advantage and
    ensure quantum safety proactively.

    In this paper, we discuss the effect of quantum advantage on the existing
    software systems and recap our seven-step roadmap, deemed 7E. The roadmap
    gives developers a structured way to start preparing for the quantum
    advantage era. We then report the results of a case study, which validates
    7E. Our software under study is the IBM Db2 database system, where we
    upgrade the existing cryptographic schemes to post-quantum cryptography
    (using Kyber and Dilithium schemes) and report our findings and learned
    lessons. The outcome of the study shows that the 7E roadmap is effective in
    helping to plan the evolution of existing software security features

    vaccine hesitancy in {US} adults: {January--May} 2021},
  author = {King, Wendy C and Rubinstein, Max and Reinhart, Alex
    and Mejia, Robin J.},
  doi = {10.1101/2021.07.20.21260795},
  abstract = {\textbf{Importance} COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has become a
    leading barrier to increasing the US vaccination rate.

    \textbf{Objective} To evaluate time trends in COVID-19 vaccine intent
    during the US vaccine rollout, and identify key factors related to and
    self-reported reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in May 2021.

    \textbf{Design, Participants and Setting} A COVID-19 survey was offered to
    US adult Facebook users in several languages yielding 5,088,772 qualifying
    responses from January 6 to May 31, 2021. Data was aggregated by month.
    Survey weights matched the sample to the age, gender, and state profile of
    the US population.

    \textbf{Exposure} Demographics, geographic factors, political/COVID-19
    environment, health status, beliefs, and behaviors.

    \textbf{Main Outcome Measures} ``If a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 were
    offered to you today, would you choose to get vaccinated.'' Hesitant was
    defined as responding, probably or definitely would not choose to get
    vaccinated (versus probably or definitely would, or already vaccinated).

    \textbf{Results} COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreased by one-third from
    25.4\% (95\%CI, 25.3, 25.5) in January to 16.6\% (95\%CI, 16.4, 16.7) in
    May, with relatively large decreases among participants with Black, Pacific
    Islander or Hispanic race/ethnicity and $\le$ high school education.
    Independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy in May ($N=525,644$)
    included younger age, non-Asian race, $<4$ year college degree, living in a
    more rural county, living in a county with higher Trump vote share in the
    2020 election, lack of worry about COVID-19, working outside the home,
    never intentionally avoiding contact with others, and no past-year flu
    vaccine. Differences in hesitancy by race/ethnicity varied by age (e.g.,
    Black adults more hesitant than White adults $<35$ years old, but less
    hesitant among adults $\ge$45 years old), and vice versa. Almost half of
    vaccine hesitant respondents reported fear of side effects (49.2\% [95\%CI,
    48.7, 49.7]) and not trusting the COVID-19 vaccine (48.4\% [95\%CI, 48.0,
    48.9]); over one-third reported not trusting the government, not needing
    the vaccine, and waiting to see if safe. Reasons differed by degree of
    vaccine intent and by race/ethnicity.

    Conclusion COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy varied by demographics, geography,
    beliefs, and behaviors, indicating a need for a range of messaging and
    policy options to target high-hesitancy groups.},

  title = {{DoubleStar}: Long-Range Attack Towards Depth Estimation based
    Obstacle Avoidance in Autonomous Systems},
  author = {Zhou, Ce and Yan, Qiben and Shi, Yan and Sun, Lichao},
  abstract = {Depth estimation-based obstacle avoidance has been widely
    adopted by autonomous systems (drones and vehicles) for safety purpose. It
    normally relies on a stereo camera to automatically detect obstacles and
    make flying/driving decisions, e.g., stopping several meters ahead of the
    obstacle in the path or moving away from the detected obstacle. In this
    paper, we explore new security risks associated with the stereo
    vision-based depth estimation algorithms used for obstacle avoidance. By
    exploiting the weaknesses of the stereo matching in depth estimation
    algorithms and the lens flare effect in optical imaging, we propose
    DoubleStar, a long-range attack that injects fake obstacle depth by
    projecting pure light from two complementary light sources.

    DoubleStar includes two distinctive attack formats: beams attack and orbs
    attack, which leverage projected light beams and lens flare orbs
    respectively to cause false depth perception. We successfully attack two
    commercial stereo cameras designed for autonomous systems (ZED and Intel
    RealSense). The visualization of fake depth perceived by the stereo cameras
    illustrates the false stereo matching induced by DoubleStar. We further use
    Ardupilot to simulate the attack and demonstrate its impact on drones. To
    validate the attack on real systems, we perform a real-world attack towards
    a commercial drone equipped with state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance
    algorithms. Our attack can continuously bring a flying drone to a sudden
    stop or drift it away across a long distance under various lighting
    conditions, even bypassing sensor fusion mechanisms. Specifically, our
    experimental results show that DoubleStar creates fake depth up to 15
    meters in distance at night and up to 8 meters during the daytime. To
    mitigate this newly discovered threat, we provide discussions on potential
    countermeasures to defend against DoubleStar.},

    Here, we demonstrate an all-optical solution for secret sharing based on
    metasurface holography. In our concept, metasurface holograms are used as
    spatially separable shares that carry an encrypted message in form of a
    holographic image. Two of these shares can be recombined by bringing them
    close together. Light passing through this stack of metasurfaces
    accumulates the phase shift of both holograms and can optically reconstruct
    the secret with high fidelity. On the other hand, the holograms generated
    by the single metasurfaces can be used for identifying each shareholder.
    Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inherent translational alignment
    sensitivity between the two stacked metasurface holograms can be used for
    spatial multiplexing, which can be further extended to realize optical
    rulers.},

    In this paper we present LANTENNA---a new type of electromagnetic attack

    and then encodes it over radio waves emanating from the Ethernet cables,
    using them as antennas. A nearby receiving device can intercept the signals
    wirelessly, decode the data, and send it to the attacker. We discuss the
    exfiltration techniques, examine the covert channel characteristics, and
    provide implementation details. Notably, the malicious code can run in an
    ordinary user-mode process and successfully operate from within a virtual

    a set of countermeasures. Our experiments show that with the LANTENNA

    it provides ideal security, FHE is expensive when executed in software, 4
    to 5 orders of magnitude slower than computing on unencrypted data. These
    overheads are a major barrier to FHE's widespread adoption. We present F1,
    the first FHE accelerator that is programmable, i.e., capable of executing
    full FHE programs. F1 builds on an in-depth architectural analysis of the
    characteristics of FHE computations that reveals acceleration
    opportunities. F1 is a wide-vector processor with novel functional units
    deeply specialized to FHE primitives, such as modular arithmetic,
    number-theoretic transforms, and structured permutations. This organization
    provides so much compute throughput that data movement becomes the
    bottleneck. Thus, F1 is primarily designed to minimize data movement. The
    F1 hardware provides an explicitly managed memory hierarchy and mechanisms
    to decouple data movement from execution. A novel compiler leverages these
    mechanisms to maximize reuse and schedule off-chip and on-chip data
    movement. We evaluate F1 using cycle-accurate simulations and RTL
    synthesis. F1 is the first system to accelerate complete FHE programs and
    outperforms state-of-the-art software implementations by gmean 5400x and by
    up to 17000x. These speedups counter most of FHE's overheads and enable new
    applications, like real-time private deep learning in the cloud.},

  title = {Why Most Results of Socio-Technical Security User Studies Are
    False},
  author = {Gross, Thomas},
  abstract = {Background. In recent years, cyber security user studies have
    been scrutinized for their reporting completeness, statistical reporting
    fidelity, statistical reliability and biases. It remains an open question
    what strength of evidence positive reports of such studies actually yield.
    We focus on the extent to which positive reports indicate relation true in
    reality, that is, a probabilistic assessment.

    Aim. This study aims at establishing the overall strength of evidence in
    cyber security user studies, with the dimensions -- Positive Predictive
    Value (PPV) and its complement False Positive Risk (FPR), -- Likelihood
    Ratio (LR), and -- Reverse-Bayesian Prior (RBP) for a fixed tolerated False
    Positive Risk.

    Method. Based on 431 coded statistical inferences in 146 cyber security
    user studies from a published SLR covering the years 2006--2016, we first
    compute a simulation of the a posteriori false positive risk based on
    assumed prior and bias thresholds. Second, we establish the observed
    likelihood ratios for positive reports. Third, we compute the reverse
    Bayesian argument on the observed positive reports by computing the prior
    required for a fixed a posteriori false positive rate.

    Results. We obtain a comprehensive analysis of the strength of evidence
    including an account of appropriate multiple comparison corrections. The
    simulations show that even in face of well-controlled conditions and high
    prior likelihoods, only few studies achieve good a posteriori
    probabilities.

    Conclusions. Our work shows that the strength of evidence of the field is
    weak and that most positive reports are likely false. From this, we learn
    what to watch out for in studies to advance the knowledge of the field.},

  abstract = {Both AMD and Intel have presented technologies for confidential
    computing in cloud environments. The proposed solutions---AMD SEV (-ES,
    -SNP) and Intel TDX---protect Virtual Machines (VMs) against attacks from
    higher privileged layers through memory encryption and integrity
    protection. This model of computation draws a new trust boundary between
    virtual devices and the VM, which in so far lacks thorough examination. In
    this paper, we therefore present an analysis of the virtual device
    interface and discuss several attack vectors against a protected VM.
    Further, we develop and evaluate VIA, an automated analysis tool to detect
    cases of improper sanitization of input recieved via the virtual device
    interface. VIA improves upon existing approaches for the automated analysis
    of device interfaces in the following aspects: (i) support for
    virtualization relevant buses, (ii) efficient Direct Memory Access (DMA)
    support and (iii) performance. VIA builds upon the Linux Kernel Library and
    clang's libfuzzer to fuzz the communication between the driver and the
    device via MMIO, PIO, and DMA. An evaluation of VIA shows that it performs
    570 executions per second on average and improves performance compared to
    existing approaches by an average factor of 2706. Using VIA, we analyzed 22
    drivers in Linux 5.10.0-rc6, thereby uncovering 50 bugs and initiating
    multiple patches to the virtual device driver interface of Linux. To prove
    our findings criticality under the threat model of AMD SEV and Intel TDX,
    we showcase three exemplary attacks based on the bugs found. The attacks
    enable a malicious hypervisor to corrupt the memory and gain code execution
    in protected VMs with SEV-ES and are theoretically applicable to SEV-SNP
    and TDX.},

  abstract = {Honeypots are decoy systems that lure attackers by presenting
    them with a seemingly vulnerable system. They provide an early detection
    mechanism as well as a method for learning how adversaries work and think.
    However, over the last years, a number of researchers have shown methods
    for fingerprinting honeypots. This significantly decreases the value of a
    honeypot; if an attacker is able to recognize the existence of such a
    system, they can evade it. In this article, we revisit the honeypot
    identification field, by providing a holistic framework that includes state
    of the art and novel fingerprinting components. We decrease the probability
    of false positives by proposing a rigid multi-step approach for labeling a
    system as a honeypot. We perform extensive scans covering 2.9 billion
    addresses of the IPv4 space and identify a total of 21,855 honeypot
    instances. Moreover, we present a number of interesting side-findings such
    as the identification of more than 354,431 non-honeypot systems that
    represent potentially vulnerable servers (e.g. SSH servers with default
    password configurations and vulnerable versions). Lastly, we discuss
    countermeasures against honeypot fingerprinting techniques.},

    data are aware of security threats and leverage widely accepted solutions
    (e.g., storage encryption, transport-level encryption, intrusion detection
    systems) to prevent or detect attacks. Yet these hardening measures do
    little to face even worse threats posed on data-in-use. Solutions such as
    Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and hardware-assisted Trusted Execution
    Environment (TEE) are nowadays among the preferred approaches for
    mitigating this type of threat. However, given the high-performance
    overhead of HE, financial institutions---whose processing rate
    requirements are stringent---are more oriented towards TEE-based
    solutions. The X-Margin Inc.\ company, for example, offers secure financial
    computations by combining the Intel SGX TEE technology and HE-based
    Zero-Knowledge Proofs, which shield customers' data-in-use even against
    malicious insiders, i.e., users having privileged access to the system.
    Despite such a solution offers strong security guarantees, it is
    constrained by having to trust Intel and by the SGX hardware extension
    availability. In this paper, we evaluate a new frontier for X-Margin, i.e.,
    performing privacy-preserving credit risk scoring via an emerging
    cryptographic scheme: Functional Encryption (FE), which allows a user to
    only learn a function of the encrypted data. We describe how the X-Margin
    application can benefit from this innovative approach and---most
    importantly---evaluate its performance impact.},

  author = {Aldaya, Alejandro Cabrera and Brumley, Billy Bob},
  abstract = {Performance degradation techniques are an important complement to
    side-channel attacks. In this work, we propose HyperDegrade---a
    combination of previous approaches and the use of simultaneous
    multithreading (SMT) architectures. In addition to the new technique, we
    investigate the root causes of performance degradation using cache
    eviction, discovering a previously unknown slowdown origin. The slowdown
    produced is significantly higher than previous approaches, which translates
    into an increased time granularity for Flush+Reload attacks. We evaluate
    HyperDegrade on different Intel microarchitectures, yielding significant
    slowdowns that achieve, in select microbenchmark cases, three orders of
    magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art. To evaluate the efficacy of
    performance degradation in side-channel amplification, we propose and
    evaluate leakage assessment metrics. The results evidence that HyperDegrade
    increases time granularity without a meaningful impact on trace quality.
    Additionally, we designed a fair experiment that compares three performance
    degradation strategies when coupled with Flush+Reload from an attacker
    perspective. We developed an attack on an unexploited vulnerability in
    OpenSSL in which HyperDegrade excels---reducing by three times the number
    of required Flush+Reload traces to succeed. Regarding cryptography
    contributions, we revisit the recently proposed Raccoon attack on TLS-DH
    key exchanges, demonstrating its application to other protocols. Using
    HyperDegrade, we developed an end-to-end attack that shows how a
    Raccoon-like attack can succeed with real data, filling a missing gap from
    previous research.},

  abstract = {Neural network applications have become popular in both
    enterprise and personal settings. Network solutions are tuned meticulously
    for each task, and designs that can robustly resolve queries end up in high
    demand. As the commercial value of accurate and performant machine learning
    models increases, so too does the demand to protect neural architectures as
    confidential investments. We explore the vulnerability of neural networks
    deployed as black boxes across accelerated hardware through electromagnetic
    side channels. We examine the magnetic flux emanating from a graphics
    processing unit's power cable, as acquired by a cheap \$3 induction sensor,
    and find that this signal betrays the detailed topology and hyperparameters
    of a black-box neural network model. The attack acquires the magnetic
    signal for one query with unknown input values, but known input dimensions.
    The network reconstruction is possible due to the modular layer sequence in
    which deep neural networks are evaluated. We find that each layer
    component's evaluation produces an identifiable magnetic signal signature,
    from which layer topology, width, function type, and sequence order can be
    inferred using a suitably trained classifier and a joint consistency
    optimization based on integer programming. We study the extent to which
    network specifications can be recovered, and consider metrics for comparing
    network similarity. We demonstrate the potential accuracy of this side
    channel attack in recovering the details for a broad range of network
    architectures, including random designs. We consider applications that may
    exploit this novel side channel exposure, such as adversarial transfer
    attacks. In response, we discuss countermeasures to protect against our
    method and other similar snooping techniques.},

  abstract = {Hacked data---data obtained in an unauthorized manner through
    illicit access to a computer or computer network---are increasingly being
    used in scientific research. Examples include conflict modelling studies
    based on WikiLeaks datasets, and studies on sexual behaviour based on data
    leaked from Ashley Madison, a dating website hacked in 2015. Studies of
    this kind are prima facie lawful because the researchers who processed the
    data had no involvement in the data breach itself, and the hacked datasets
    were made publicly available. However, research integrity is not simply
    reducible to lawfulness. We contend that the ethical acceptability of using
    datasets of illicit origin cannot simply be presumed, but requires ethical
    justification. Therefore, the scientific community is urged to address a
    fundamental ethical question: whether, and under which conditions,
    conducting research using hacked data can be considered morally justifiable
    behaviour. This contribution will discuss and critically evaluate the
    ethical boundaries of research involving hacked data. This emerging ethical
    dilemma will be examined by analogy with previous debates on the ethics of
    research using data of unethical origin, such as research with data from
    Nazi medical experiments. Furthermore, we discuss the compatibility of
    research involving hacked data with current research ethics instruments
    such as the Belmont Report and the Oviedo Convention. We posit that
    research using hacked data should be deemed ethically problematic. However,
    exceptions may be acknowledged, depending on how the data are processed and
    the overall value of the study to society. To this end, we propose six
    ethical and procedural requirements for conducting research with hacked
    data in an ethically responsible manner.},

    outstanding performance in several tasks, such as image classification and
    natural language processing. However, recent studies have indicated that
    both digital and physical adversarial examples can fool neural networks.
    Face-recognition systems are used in various applications that involve
    security threats from physical adversarial examples. Herein, we propose a
    physical adversarial attack with the use of full-face makeup. The presence
    of makeup on the human face is a reasonable possibility, which possibly
    increases the imperceptibility of attacks. In our attack framework, we
    combine the cycle-adversarial generative network (cycle-GAN) and a
    victimized classifier. The Cycle-GAN is used to generate adversarial
    makeup, and the architecture of the victimized classifier is VGG 16. Our
    experimental results show that our attack can effectively overcome manual
    errors in makeup application, such as color and position-related errors. We
    also demonstrate that the approaches used to train the models can influence
    physical attacks; the adversarial perturbations crafted from the
    pre-trained model are affected by the corresponding training data.},

  author = {Deng, Shuwen and Huang, Bowen and Szefer, Jakub},
  abstract = {This paper evaluates new security threats due to the processor
    frontend in modern Intel processors. The security threats are based on new
    timing and power covert channels. The root causes of the security threats
    are the multiple paths in the processor frontend that the micro-ops can
    take: through the Micro-Instruction Translation Engine (MITE), through the
    Decode Stream Buffer (DSB), also called the Micro-op Cache, or through the
    Loop Stream Detector (LSD). Each path has its own unique timing and power
    signatures, which lead to the security threats presented in this work. In
    addition, the switching between the different paths can lead to observable
    timing or power differences which could be exploited by attackers. Because
    of the different paths, the switching, and the way the components are
    shared in the frontend between hardware threads, two separate threads are
    able to be mutually influenced and timing or power can reveal activity on
    the other thread. The security threats are not limited to multi-threading,
    and this work further demonstrates new ways for leaking execution
    information about SGX enclaves or a new in-domain Spectre variant. In
    addition, this work demonstrates a new method for fingerprinting the
    microcode patches of the processor by analyzing the behavior of different
    paths in the frontend. This work demonstrates that the whole processor
    frontend needs to be considered when ensuring the security of processor

  abstract = {We introduce the Clockwork Finance Framework (CFF), a general
    purpose, formal verification framework for mechanized reasoning about the
    economic security properties of composed decentralized-finance (DeFi) smart
    contracts.

    CFF features three key properties. It is contract complete, meaning that it
    can model any smart contract platform and all its contracts -- Turing
    complete or otherwise. It does so with asymptotically optimal model size.
    It is also attack-exhaustive by construction, meaning that it can
    automatically and mechanically extract all possible economic attacks on
    users' cryptocurrency across modeled contracts.

    Thanks to these properties, CFF can support multiple goals: economic
    security analysis of contracts by developers, analysis of DeFi trading
    risks by users, and optimization of arbitrage opportunities by bots or
    miners. Because CFF offers composability, it can support these goals with
    reasoning over any desired set of potentially interacting smart contract
    models.

    We instantiate CFF as an executable model for Ethereum contracts that
    incorporates a state-of-the-art deductive verifier. Building on previous
    work, we introduce extractable value (EV), a new formal notion of economic
    security in composed DeFi contracts that is both a basis for CFF analyses
    and of general interest.

    We construct modular, human-readable, composable CFF models of four
    popular, deployed DeFi protocols in Ethereum: Uniswap, Uniswap V2,
    Sushiswap, and MakerDAO, representing a combined 17 billion USD in value as
    of August 2021. We uses these models to show experimentally that CFF is
    practical and can drive useful, data-based EV-based insights from real
    world transaction activity. Without any explicitly programmed attack
    strategies, CFF uncovers on average an expected \$56 million of EV per
    month in the recent past.},

  abstract = {In a random number generation task, participants are asked to
    generate a random sequence of numbers, most typically the digits 1 to 9.
    Such number sequences are not mathematically random, and both extent and
    type of bias allow one to characterize the brain's ``internal random number
    generator''. We assume that certain patterns and their variations will
    frequently occur in humanly generated random number sequences. Thus, we
    introduce a pattern-based analysis of random number sequences. Twenty
    healthy subjects randomly generated two sequences of 300 numbers each.
    Sequences were analysed to identify the patterns of numbers predominantly
    used by the subjects and to calculate the frequency of a specific pattern
    and its variations within the number sequence. This pattern analysis is
    based on the Damerau--Levenshtein distance, which counts the number of edit
    operations that are needed to convert one string into another. We built a
    model that predicts not only the next item in a humanly generated random
    number sequence based on the item′s immediate history, but also the
    deployment of patterns in another sequence generated by the same subject.
    When a history of seven items was computed, the mean correct prediction
    rate rose up to 27\% (with an individual maximum of 46\%, chance
    performance of 11\%). Furthermore, we assumed that when predicting one
    subject′s sequence, predictions based on statistical information from the
    same subject should yield a higher success rate than predictions based on
    statistical information from a different subject. When provided with two
    sequences from the same subject and one from a different subject, an
    algorithm identifies the foreign sequence in up to 88\% of the cases. In
    conclusion, the pattern-based analysis using the Levenshtein--Damarau
    distance is both able to predict humanly generated random number sequences
    and to identify person-specific information within a humanly generated
    random number sequence.},

    is only known from a limited number of animal groups. For birds, oscine and
    some suboscine songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds demonstrate this
    ability. Here, we provide evidence for vocal learning in a member of a
    basal clade of the avian phylogeny: the Australian musk duck (Biziura
    lobata). A hand-reared individual imitated a slamming door and a human
    voice, and a female-reared individual imitated Pacific black duck quacks.
    These sounds have been described before, but were never analysed in any
    detail and went so far unnoticed by researchers of vocal learning. The
    imitations were produced during the males' advertising display. The
    hand-reared male used at least three different vocalizations in the display
    context, with each one produced in the same stereotyped and repetitive
    structure as the normal display sounds. Sounds of different origins could
    be combined in one vocalization and at least some of the imitations were
    memorized at an early age, well before they were produced later in life.
    Together with earlier observations of vocal differences between populations
    and deviant vocalizations in captive-reared individuals, these observations
    demonstrate the presence of advanced vocal learning at a level comparable
    to that of songbirds and parrots. We discuss the rearing conditions that
    may have given rise to the imitations and suggest that the structure of the
    duck vocalizations indicates a quite sophisticated and flexible control
    over the vocal production mechanism. The observations support the
    hypothesis that vocal learning in birds evolved in several groups
    independently rather than evolving once with several losses.},

  abstract = {Why are online discussions about politics more hostile than
    offline discussions? A popular answer argues that human psychology is
    tailored for face-to-face interaction and people's behavior therefore
    changes for the worse in impersonal online discussions. We provide a
    theoretical formalization and empirical test of this explanation: the
    mismatch hypothesis. We argue that mismatches between human psychology and
    novel features of online environments could (a) change people's behavior,
    (b) create adverse selection effects, and (c) bias people's perceptions.
    Across eight studies, leveraging cross-national surveys and behavioral
    experiments (total $N = 8,434$), we test the mismatch hypothesis but only
    find evidence for limited selection effects. Instead, hostile political
    discussions are the result of status-driven individuals who are drawn to
    politics and are equally hostile both online and offline. Finally, we offer

  author = {Kell, Tyler and Yousaf, Haaroon and Allen, Sarah
    and Meiklejohn, Sarah and Juels, Ari},
  abstract = {Pyramid schemes are investment scams in which top-level
    participants in a hierarchical network recruit and profit from an expanding
    base of defrauded newer participants. Pyramid schemes have existed for over
    a century, but there have been no in-depth studies of their dynamics and
    communities because of the opacity of participants' transactions.

    In this paper, we present an empirical study of Forsage, a pyramid scheme
    implemented as a smart contract and at its peak one of the largest
    consumers of resources in Ethereum. As a smart contract, Forsage makes its
    (byte)code and all of its transactions visible on the blockchain. We take
    advantage of this unprecedented transparency to gain insight into the
    mechanics, impact on participants, and evolution of Forsage.

    We quantify the (multi-million-dollar) gains of top-level participants as
    well as the losses of the vast majority (around 88\%) of users. We analyze
    Forsage code both manually and using a purpose-built transaction simulator
    to uncover the complex mechanics of the scheme. Through complementary study
    of promotional videos and social media, we show how Forsage promoters have
    leveraged the unique features of smart contracts to lure users with false
    claims of trustworthiness and profitability, and how Forsage activity is
    concentrated within a small number of national communities.},

  author = {Li, Dongyang and Yang, Lin and Zhang, Hongguang and Wang, Xiaolei

  abstract = {Insider threat detection has been a challenging task over
    decades, existing approaches generally employ the traditional generative
    unsupervised learning methods to produce normal user behavior model and
    detect significant deviations as anomalies. However, such approaches are
    insufficient in precision and computational complexity. In this paper, we
    propose a novel insider threat detection method, Image-based Insider Threat
    Detector via Geometric Transformation (IGT), which converts the
    unsupervised anomaly detection into supervised image classification task,
    and therefore the performance can be boosted via computer vision
    techniques. To illustrate, our IGT uses a novel image-based feature
    representation of user behavior by transforming audit logs into grayscale
    images. By applying multiple geometric transformations on these behavior
    grayscale images, IGT constructs a self-labelled dataset and then train a
    behavior classifier to detect anomaly in self-supervised manner. The
    motivation behind our proposed method is that images converted from normal
    behavior data may contain unique latent features which keep unchanged after
    geometric transformation, while malicious ones cannot. Experimental results
    on CERT dataset show IGT outperforms the classical autoencoder-based
    unsupervised insider threat detection approaches, and improves the instance
    and user based Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
    (AUROC) by 4\% and 2\%, respectively.},

  title = {{Elysium}: Automagically Healing Vulnerable Smart Contracts Using
    Context-Aware Patching},
  author = {Torres, Christof Ferreira and Jonker, Hugo and State, Radu},
  abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that are deployed and executed on
    the blockchain. Typically, smart contracts govern assets; popular smart
    contracts can govern assets worth millions. Just like traditional programs,
    smart contracts are subject to programming mistakes. However, a major
    difference is that smart contracts cannot be patched once deployed. Several
    approaches have been studied to improve smart contract security, by
    detecting bugs prior to deployment, allowing contracts to be updated, or
    modifying clients to prevent attacking transactions. The most elegant
    solution would be to automatically eliminate bugs prior to deployment.
    Merely identifying bugs is not enough. This became evident when the Parity
    wallet was hacked a second time after being manually patched following a
    security audit. Automatic pre-deployment patching offers a powerful promise
    to strengthen smart contract defenses. Current approaches are limited in
    the types of vulnerabilities that can be patched, in the flexibility of the
    patching process, and in scalability. In this paper we propose Elysium, a
    scalable approach towards automatic smart contract repair, that combines
    template-based patching with semantic patching by inferring context
    information from the bytecode. Elysium can currently automatically patch 7
    known vulnerabilities in smart contracts using external bug-finding tools,
    and it can easily be extended with new templates and new bug-finding tools.
    We evaluate effectiveness and correctness of Elysium using 3 different
    datasets by replaying more than 500K transactions against patched
    contracts. We find that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at
    least 30\% more contracts. Finally, we compare the overhead in terms of
    deployment and transaction cost increase. In comparison to other tools,
    Elysium minimizes transaction cost (up to a factor of 1.9), for only a
    marginally higher deployment cost.},

  abstract = {In order to withstand the ever-increasing invasion of privacy by
    CCTV cameras and technologies, on par CCTV-aware solutions must exist that
    provide privacy, safety, and cybersecurity features. We argue that a first
    important step towards such CCTV-aware solutions must be a mapping system
    (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) that provides both privacy and safety
    routing and navigation options. However, this in turn requires that the
    mapping system contains updated information on CCTV cameras' exact
    geo-location, coverage area, and possibly other meta-data (e.g.,
    resolution, facial recognition features, operator). Such information is
    however missing from current mapping systems, and there are several ways to
    fix this. One solution is to perform CCTV camera detection on geo-location
    tagged images, e.g., street view imagery on various platforms, user images
    publicly posted in image sharing platforms such as Flickr. Unfortunately,
    to the best of our knowledge, there are no computer vision models for CCTV
    camera object detection as well as no mapping system that supports privacy
    and safety routing options.

    To close these gaps, with this paper we introduce CCTVCV -- the first and
    only computer vision MS COCO-compatible models that are able to accurately
    detect CCTV and video surveillance cameras in images and video frames. To
    this end, our best detectors were built using 8387 images that were
    manually reviewed and annotated to contain 10419 CCTV camera instances, and
    achieve an accuracy of up to 98.7\%. Moreover, we build and evaluate
    multiple models, present a comprehensive comparison of their performance,
    and outline core challenges associated with such research.},

    require the line-of-sight between the adversary and the target camera. In
    this paper, we present a novel post-transducer signal injection attack

    and even military settings. We show how electromagnetic emanation can be
    used to manipulate the image information captured by a CCD image sensor
    with the granularity down to the brightness of individual pixels. We study
    the feasibility of our attack and then demonstrate its effects in the

  abstract = {Finding bugs in microcontroller (MCU) firmware is challenging,
    even for device manufacturers who own the source code. The MCU runs
    different instruction sets than x86 and exposes a very different
    development environment. This invalidates many existing sophisticated
    software testing tools on x86. To maintain a unified developing and testing
    environment, a straightforward way is to re-compile the source code into
    the native executable for a commodity machine (called rehosting). However,
    ad-hoc re-hosting is a daunting and tedious task and subject to many issues
    (library-dependence, kernel-dependence and hardware-dependence). In this
    work, we systematically explore the portability problem of MCU software and
    propose pararehosting to ease the porting process. Specifically, we
    abstract and implement a portable MCU (PMCU) using the POSIX interface. It
    models common functions of the MCU cores. For peripheral specific logic, we
    propose HAL-based peripheral function replacement, in which high-level
    hardware functions are replaced with an equivalent backend driver on the
    host. These backend drivers are invoked by well-designed para-APIs and can
    be reused across many MCU OSs. We categorize common HAL functions into four
    types and implement templates for quick backend development. Using the
    proposed approach, we have successfully rehosted nine MCU OSs including the
    widely deployed Amazon FreeRTOS, ARM Mbed OS, Zephyr and LiteOS. To
    demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of security testing,
    we used off-the-shelf dynamic analysis tools (AFL and ASAN) against the
    rehosted programs and discovered 28 previously-unknown bugs, among which 5
    were confirmed by CVE and the other 19 were confirmed by vendors at the
    time of writing.},

    Attacks},
  author = {Fleury, Nicolas and Dubrunquez, Theo and Alouani, Ihsen},
  abstract = {In the recent years, Portable Document Format, commonly known as
    PDF, has become a democratized standard for document exchange and
    dissemination. This trend has been due to its characteristics such as its
    flexibility and portability across platforms. The widespread use of PDF has
    installed a false impression of inherent safety among benign users.
    However, the characteristics of PDF motivated hackers to exploit various
    types of vulnerabilities, overcome security safeguards, thereby making the
    PDF format one of the most efficient malicious code attack vectors.
    Therefore, efficiently detecting malicious PDF files is crucial for
    information security. Several analysis techniques has been proposed in the
    literature, be it static or dynamic, to extract the main features that
    allow the discrimination of malware files from benign ones. Since classical
    analysis techniques may be limited in case of zero-days, machine-learning
    based techniques have emerged recently as an automatic PDF-malware
    detection method that is able to generalize from a set of training samples.
    These techniques are themselves facing the challenge of evasion attacks
    where a malicious PDF is transformed to look benign. In this work, we give
    an overview on the PDF-malware detection problem. We give a perspective on
    the new challenges and emerging solutions.},

    and Seifert, Jean-Pierre},
  abstract = {Voltage fault injection (FI) is a well-known attack technique
    that can be used to force faulty behavior in processors during their
    operation. Glitching the supply voltage can cause data value corruption,
    skip security checks, or enable protected code paths. At the same time,
    modern systems on a chip (SoCs) are used in security-critical applications,
    such as self-driving cars and autonomous machines. Since these embedded
    devices are often physically accessible by attackers, vendors must consider
    device tampering in their threat models. However, while the threat of
    voltage FI is known since the early 2000s, it seems as if vendors still
    forget to integrate countermeasures. This work shows how the entire boot
    security of an Nvidia SoC, used in Tesla's autopilot and Mercedes-Benz's
    infotainment system, can be circumvented using voltage FI. We uncover a
    hidden bootloader that is only available to the manufacturer for testing
    purposes and disabled by fuses in shipped products. We demonstrate how to
    re-enable this bootloader using FI to gain code execution with the highest
    privileges, enabling us to extract the bootloader's firmware and decryption
    keys used in later boot stages. Using a hardware implant, an adversary
    might misuse the hidden bootloader to bypass trusted code execution even
    during the system's regular operation.},

    for wearables and mobile applications. Meanwhile, the growing adoption of
    sensors in wearables also provides opportunities to capture novel wearable
    biometrics. In this work, we propose EarDynamic, an ear canal
    deformation-based user authentication using in-ear wearables. EarDynamic
    provides continuous and passive user authentication and is transparent to
    users. It leverages ear canal deformation that combines the unique static
    geometry and dynamic motions of the ear canal when the user is speaking for
    authentication. It utilizes an acoustic sensing approach to capture the ear
    canal deformation with the built-in microphone and speaker of the in-ear
    wearable. Specifically, it first emits well-designed inaudible beep signals
    and records the reflected signals from the ear canal. It then analyzes the
    reflected signals and extracts fine-grained acoustic features that
    correspond to the ear canal deformation for user authentication. Our
    extensive experimental evaluation shows that EarDynamic can achieve a
    recall of 97.38\% and an F1 score of 96.84\%. Results also show that our
    system works well under different noisy environments with various daily

  abstract = {Two main classes of optical TEMPEST attacks against the
    confidentiality of information processed/delivered by devices have been
    demonstrated in the past two decades; the first class includes methods for
    recovering content from monitors, and the second class includes methods for
    recovering keystrokes from physical and virtual keyboards.

    In this paper, we identify a new class of optical TEMPEST attacks:
    recovering sound by analyzing optical emanations from a device's power
    indicator LED.

    We analyze the response of the power indicator LED of various devices to
    sound and show that there is an optical correlation between the sound that
    is played by connected speakers and the intensity of their power indicator
    LED due to the facts that: (1) the power indicator LED of various devices
    is connected directly to the power line, (2) the intensity of a device's
    power indicator LED is correlative to the power consumption, and (3) many
    devices lack a dedicated means of countering this phenomenon.

    Based on our findings, we present the Glowworm attack, an optical TEMPEST
    attack that can be used by eavesdroppers to recover sound by analyzing
    optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the
    power indicator LED of various devices (e.g., speakers, USB hub splitters,
    and microcontrollers).

    We propose an optical-audio transformation (OAT) to recover sound by
    isolating the speech from the optical measurements obtained by directing an
    electro-optical sensor at a device's power indicator LED.

    Finally, we test the performance of the Glowworm attack in various
    experimental setups and show that an eavesdropper can apply the attack to
    recover speech from a speaker's power indicator LED with good
    intelligibility from a distance of 15 meters and with fair intelligibility
    from 35 meters.},

  abstract = {Quantum many-body systems display rich phase structure in their
    low-temperature equilibrium states. However, much of nature is not in
    thermal equilibrium. Remarkably, it was recently predicted that
    out-of-equilibrium systems can exhibit novel dynamical phases that may
    otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics, a paradigmatic
    example being the discrete time crystal (DTC). Concretely, dynamical phases
    can be defined in periodically driven many-body localized systems via the
    concept of eigenstate order. In eigenstate-ordered phases, the entire
    many-body spectrum exhibits quantum correlations and long-range order, with
    characteristic signatures in late-time dynamics from all initial states. It
    is, however, challenging to experimentally distinguish such stable phases
    from transient phenomena, wherein few select states can mask typical
    behavior. Here we implement a continuous family of tunable CPHASE gates on
    an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally observe an
    eigenstate-ordered DTC. We demonstrate the characteristic spatiotemporal
    response of a DTC for generic initial states. Our work employs a
    time-reversal protocol that discriminates external decoherence from
    intrinsic thermalization, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent
    the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. In addition, we
    locate the phase transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size
    analysis. These results establish a scalable approach to study
    non-equilibrium phases of matter on current quantum processors.},

  abstract = {Realizing the potential of quantum computing requires
    sufficiently low logical error rates1. Many applications call for error
    rates as low as $10^{-15}$ (refs. 2--9), but state-of-the-art quantum
    platforms typically have physical error rates near $10^{-3}$ (refs.
    10--14). Quantum error correction 15--17 promises to bridge this divide by
    distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in
    such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded
    logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of
    physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a
    certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we
    implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional
    grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of
    bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than
    100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this
    error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also
    introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision,
    allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error
    correction. Finally, we perform error detection with a small logical qubit
    using the 2D surface code on the same device 18,19 and show that the
    results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical
    simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental
    demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant
    quantum computer with superconducting qubits.},

    Logic State Imaging},
  author = {Krachenfels, Thilo and Seifert, Jean-Pierre and Tajik, Shahin},
  abstract = {The threat of hardware Trojans (HTs) and their detection is a
    widely studied field. While the effort for inserting a Trojan into an
    application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) can be considered relatively
    high, especially when trusting the chip manufacturer, programmable hardware
    is vulnerable to Trojan insertion even after the product has been shipped
    or during usage. At the same time, detecting dormant HTs with small or
    zero-overhead triggers and payloads on these platforms is still a
    challenging task, as the Trojan might not get activated during the chip
    verification using logical testing or physical measurements. In this work,
    we present a novel Trojan detection approach based on a technique known
    from integrated circuit (IC) failure analysis, capable of detecting
    virtually all classes of dormant Trojans. Using laser logic state imaging
    (LLSI), we show how supply voltage modulations can awaken inactive Trojans,
    making them detectable using laser voltage imaging techniques. Therefore,
    our technique does not require triggering the Trojan. To support our
    claims, we present two case studies on 28 SRAM- and flash-based
    field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We demonstrate how to detect with
    high confidence small changes in sequential and combinatorial logic as well
    as in the routing configuration of FPGAs in a non-invasive manner. Finally,
    we discuss the practical applicability of our approach on dormant analog
    Trojans in ASICs.},

  title = {The analysis approach of {ThreatGet}},
  author = {Christl, Korbinian and Tarrach, Thorsten},
  abstract = {Nowadays, almost all electronic devices include a communication
    interface that allows to interact with them, exchange data, or operate
    their services remotely. The trend toward increased interconnectivity
    simultaneously increases the vulnerability of these systems. Due to the
    high costs associated with comprehensive security analysis, many
    manufacturers neglect the safety aspect of a product in order to avoid
    costs. However, the importance of secure IT systems is growing, as the
    security of a system can also influence safety-critical aspects. Standard
    security analysis approaches are nowadays still mainly based on
    time-intensive and error-prone manual activities. In this paper, we present
    the formal concepts of the automatic threat and vulnerability analysis tool
    ThreatGet. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the Extended Data-Flow
    Diagram that is used to represent the system under investigation in an
    abstracted form, and we highlight the formal analysis language of the tool.
    This domain-specific language is used to formulate so-called anti-patterns.
    These anti-patterns that can be interpreted by the tool for an automatic
    security analysis of the system. Besides the language declaration, we
    present the entire semantic evaluation of the language during the analysis.
    Parts of the definitions and elaborations of the diagram model and the
    analysis language were developed in the context of the master thesis of
    Korbinian Christl, in cooperation with the University of Vienna.},

  title = {Factors determining maximum energy consumption of {Bitcoin} miners},
  author = {Gonzalez-Barahona, Jesus M.},
  abstract = {Background: During the last years, there has been a lot of
    discussion and estimations on the energy consumption of Bitcoin miners.
    However, most of the studies are focused on estimating energy consumption,
    not in exploring the factors that determine it.

    Goal: To explore the factors that determine maximum energy consumption of
    Bitcoin miners. In particular, analyze the limits of energy consumption,
    and to which extent variations of the factors could produce its reduction.

    Method: Estimate the overall profit of all Bitcoin miners during a certain
    period of time, and the costs (including energy) that they face during that
    time, because of the mining activity. The underlying assumptions is that
    miners will only consume energy to mine Bitcoin if they have the
    expectation of profit, and at the same time they are competitive with
    respect of each other. Therefore, they will operate as a group in the point
    where profits balance expenditures.

    Results: We show a basic equation that determines energy consumption based
    on some specific factors: minting, transaction fees, exchange rate, energy
    price, and amortization cost. We also define the Amortization Factor, which
    can be computed for mining devices based on their cost and energy
    consumption, helps to understand how the cost of equipment influences total
    energy consumption.

    Conclusions: The factors driving energy consumption are identified, and
    from them, some ways in which Bitcoin energy consumption could be reduced
    are discussed. Some of these ways do not reduce the most important
    properties of Bitcoin, such as the chances of control of the aggregated
    hashpower, or the fundamentals of the proof of work mechanism. In general,
    the methods presented can help to predict energy consumption in different
    scenarios, based on factors that can be calculated from available data, or
    assumed in scenarios.},

    Continued sea-level rise (SLR) will exacerbate the issue where present, and
    many more locations will begin to experience recurrent high-tide flooding
    (HTF) in the coming decades. Here we use established SLR scenarios and
    flooding thresholds to demonstrate how the combined effects of SLR and
    nodal cycle modulations of tidal amplitude lead to acute inflections in
    projections of future HTF. The mid-2030s, in particular, may see the onset
    of rapid increases in the frequency of HTF in multiple US coastal regions.
    We also show how annual cycles and sea-level anomalies lead to extreme
    seasons or months during which many days of HTF cluster together.
    Clustering can lead to critical frequencies of HTF occurring during monthly
    or seasonal periods one to two decades prior to being expected on an annual
    basis.},

    isolation-based defensive mechanism based on the rules that are introduced
    by the manufacturer of the device. However, in practice, the access control
    list of each device is defined in its MUD-File and may contain possibly
    hundreds of access control rules. As a result, reading and validating these
    files is a challenge; and determining how multiple IoT devices interact is
    difficult for the developer and infeasible for the consumer. To address
    this we introduce the MUD-Visualizer to provide a visualization of any
    number of MUD-Files. MUD-Visualizer is designed to enable developers to
    produce correct MUD-Files by providing format correction, integrating them
    with other MUD-Files, and identifying conflicts through visualization.
    MUD-Visualizer is scalable and its core task is to merge and illustrate
    ACEs for multiple devices; both within and beyond the local area network.

    Bentham in 1785. This device was, later, used by Foucault and other
    philosophers as a paradigm and metaphor for the study of constitutional
    power and knowledge as well as a model of individuals' deprivation of
    freedom. Nowadays, technological achievements have given rise to new,
    non-physical (unlike prisons), means of constant surveillance that
    transcend physical boundaries. This, combined with the confession of some
    governmental institutions that they actually collaborate with these
    Internet giants to collect or deduce information about people, creates a
    worrisome situation of several co-existing Panopticons that can act
    separately or in close collaboration. Thus, they can only be detected and
    identified through the expense of (perhaps considerable) effort. In this
    paper we provide a theoretical framework for studying the detectability
    status of Panopticons that fall under two theoretical, but not unrealistic,
    definitions. We show, using Oracle Turing Machines, that detecting modern
    day, ICT-based, Panopticons is an undecidable problem. Furthermore, we show
    that for each sufficiently expressive formal system, we can effectively
    construct a Turing Machine for which it is impossible to prove, within the
    formal system, either that it is a Panopticon or it is not a Panopticon.},

  abstract = {The security of the Internet rests on a small number of
    open-source cryptographic libraries: a vulnerability in any one of them
    threatens to compromise a significant percentage of web traffic. Despite
    this potential for security impact, the characteristics and causes of
    vulnerabilities in cryptographic software are not well understood. In this
    work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of cryptographic
    libraries and the vulnerabilities affecting them. We collect data from the
    National Vulnerability Database, individual project repositories and
    mailing lists, and other relevant sources for eight widely used
    cryptographic libraries.

    Among our most interesting findings is that only 27.2\% of vulnerabilities
    in cryptographic libraries are cryptographic issues while 37.2\% of
    vulnerabilities are memory safety issues, indicating that systems-level
    bugs are a greater security concern than the actual cryptographic
    procedures. In our investigation of the causes of these vulnerabilities, we
    find evidence of a strong correlation between the complexity of these
    libraries and their (in)security, empirically demonstrating the potential
    risks of bloated cryptographic codebases. We further compare our findings
    with non-cryptographic systems, observing that these systems are, indeed,
    more complex than similar counterparts, and that this excess complexity
    appears to produce significantly more vulnerabilities in cryptographic
    libraries than in non-cryptographic software.},

  abstract = {A covert channel is a communication channel that is not intended
    to exist, and that can be used to transfer information in a manner that
    violates the system security policy. Attackers can abuse such channels to
    exfiltrate sensitive information from cyber-physical systems (CPSs), for
    example to leak the confidential or proprietary parameters in a control
    system. Furthermore, attacks against CPSs can exploit the leaked
    information about the implementation of the control system, for example to
    determine optimal false data injection attack values that degrade the
    system performance while remaining undetected. In this study, a control
    theoretic approach for establishing covert channels in stochastic CPSs is
    presented. In particular, a scenario is considered where an attacker is
    able to inject malware into the networked controller and arbitrarily alter
    the control logic. By exploiting such capability, an attacker can establish
    an illegitimate communication channel, for example to transmit sensitive
    plant parameters, between the networked controller and an eavesdropper
    intercepting the sensor measurements. The authors show that such a channel
    can be established by exploiting the closed-loop system operations, a
    decoding mechanism based on an unknown input observer, and an
    error-correcting coding scheme that exploits the control loop to obtain an
    implicit acknowledgement. A simple proof of concept implementation of the
    covert channel is presented, and its performance is evaluated by resorting
    to a numerical example. Finally, some defences and countermeasures are
    proposed against the proposed covert channel.},

  title = {Laptop Theft in a University Setting can be Avoided with Warnings},
  author = {Nadeem, Azqa and Junger, Marianne},
  abstract = {Laptops have become an indispensable asset in today's digital
    age. They often contain highly sensitive information, such as credentials
    and confidential documents. As a result, the value of a laptop is an
    accumulation of the value of both the physical device itself and the cyber
    assets it contains, making it a lucrative target for theft. Educational
    institutions have a large population of potential victims of laptop theft.
    To mitigate this risk, we investigate whether a simple warning sign can
    reduce the opportunity for potential offenders. To this end, we have
    conducted an empirical study to observe the prevalence of students/staff
    leaving their laptops unattended at a university study hall at the Delft
    University of Technology in the Netherlands, both with and without a
    warning sign. We observed 148 out of 220 subjects leaving their laptops
    unattended in just three weeks. The results also showed that without the
    warning banner, 75.5\% (83 out of 110) of subjects left their laptops
    unattended and with the warning, only 59.1\% (65 out of 110) of subjects
    showed the same behavior, which is a significant reduction of 16.4\%. In
    addition, a qualitative analysis was performed on the responses of subjects
    who left their laptops unattended after the warning banner was placed. The
    results showed a mix of convenience, and a blind trust on the safety of the
    faculty. In conclusion, a simple banner was effective in reducing the
    opportunity for laptop theft. However, the percentage of laptops left
    unattended was still high even after the introduction of the banner.},

  title = {Mirror Mirror on the Wall: Next-Generation Wireless Jamming Attacks
    Based on Software-Controlled Surfaces},
  author = {Staat, Paul and Elders-Boll, Harald and Zenger, Christian
    and Paar, Christof},
  abstract = {The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new
    paradigm in wireless communications to meet the growing demand for
    high-speed connectivity in next-generation mobile networks. IRS, also known
    as software-controlled metasurfaces, consist of an array of adjustable
    radio wave reflectors, enabling smart radio environments, e.g., for
    enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial diversity of wireless
    channels.

    Research on IRS to date has been largely focused on constructive
    applications. In this work, we show for the first time that the IRS
    provides a practical low-cost toolkit for attackers to easily perform
    complex signal manipulation attacks on the physical layer in real time. We
    introduce the environment reconfiguration attack (ERA) as a novel class of
    jamming attacks in wireless radio networks. Here, an adversary leverages an
    IRS to rapidly vary the electromagnetic propagation environment to disturb
    legitimate receivers. The IRS gives the adversary a key advantage over
    traditional jamming: It no longer has to actively emit a jamming signal
    itself while the jamming signal is correlated to the legitimate
    communication signal.

    We thoroughly investigate the ERA using the popular orthogonal frequency
    division multiplexing~(OFDM) modulation as an example. We show that the ERA
    allows to severely degrade the available data rates even in entire
    networks. We present insights to the attack through analytical analysis,
    simulations, as well as experiments. Our results highlight that the attack
    also works with reasonably small IRS sizes. Finally, we implement an
    attacker setup and demonstrate a practical ERA to slow down a Wi-Fi
    network.},

    domains other than the domain queried with a web browser. The dataset
    covers nearly ten thousand domains and over three hundred thousand TCP
    connections initiated by querying popular Finnish websites and globally
    popular sites. According to the results, (i) cross-domain connections are
    extremely common in the current Web. (ii) Most of these transmit encrypted
    content, although mixed content delivery is relatively common; many of the
    cross-domain connections deliver unencrypted content at the same time.
    (iii) Many of the cross-domain connections are initiated to known web
    advertisement domains, but a much larger share traces to social media
    platforms and cloud infrastructures. Finally, (iv) the results differ
    slightly between the Finnish web sites sampled and the globally popular
    sites. With these results, the paper contributes to the ongoing work for
    better understanding cross-domain connections and dependencies in the world

  abstract = {These days, cyber-criminals target humans rather than machines
    since they try to accomplish their malicious intentions by exploiting the
    weaknesses of end users. Thus, human vulnerabilities pose a serious threat
    to the security and integrity of computer systems and data. The human
    tendency to trust and help others, as well as personal, social, and
    cultural characteristics, are indicative of the level of susceptibility
    that one may exhibit towards certain attack types and deception strategies.
    This work aims to investigate the factors that affect human susceptibility
    by studying the existing literature related to this subject. The objective
    is also to explore and describe state of the art human vulnerability
    assessment models, current prevention, and mitigation approaches regarding
    user susceptibility, as well as educational and awareness raising training
    strategies. Following the review of the literature, several conclusions are
    reached. Among them, Human Vulnerability Assessment has been included in
    various frameworks aiming to assess the cyber security capacity of
    organizations, but it concerns a one time assessment rather than a
    continuous practice. Moreover, human maliciousness is still neglected from
    current Human Vulnerability Assessment frameworks; thus, insider threat
    actors evade identification, which may lead to an increased cyber security
    risk. Finally, this work proposes a user susceptibility profile according
    to the factors stemming from our research.},

  title = {Intentional Forgetting},
  author = {Shands, Deborah and Talcott, Carolyn},
  abstract = {Many damaging cybersecurity attacks are enabled when an attacker
    can access residual sensitive information (e.g. cryptographic keys,
    personal identifiers) left behind from earlier computation. Attackers can
    sometimes use residual information to take control of a system, impersonate
    a user, or manipulate data. Current approaches to addressing access to
    residual sensitive information aim to patch individual software or hardware
    vulnerabilities. While such patching approaches are necessary to mitigate
    sometimes serious security vulnerabilities in the near term, they cannot
    address the underlying issue: explicit requirements for adequately
    eliminating residual information and explicit representations of the
    erasure capabilities of systems are necessary to ensure that sensitive
    information is handled as expected.

    This position paper introduces the concept of intentional forgetting and
    the capabilities that are needed to achieve it. Intentional forgetting
    enables software and hardware system designers at every level of
    abstraction to clearly specify and rigorously reason about the forgetting
    capabilities required of and provided by a system. We identify related work
    that may help to illuminate challenges or contribute to solutions and
    consider conceptual and engineering tradeoffs in implementations of
    forgetting capabilities. We discuss approaches to modeling intentional
    forgetting and then modeling the strength of a system's forgetting
    capability by its resistance to disclosing information to different types
    of detectors. Research is needed in a variety of domains to advance the
    theory, specification techniques, system foundations, implementation tools,
    and methodologies for effective, practical forgetting. We highlight
    research challenges in several domains and encourage cross-disciplinary
    collaboration to one day create a robust theory and practice of intentional
    forgetting.},

  abstract = {Radar systems are mainly used for tracking aircraft, missiles,
    satellites, and watercraft. In many cases, information regarding the
    objects detected by the radar system is sent to, and used by, a peripheral
    consuming system, such as a missile system or a graphical user interface
    used by an operator. Those systems process the data stream and make
    real-time, operational decisions based on the data received. Given this,
    the reliability and availability of information provided by radar systems
    has grown in importance. Although the field of cyber security has been
    continuously evolving, no prior research has focused on anomaly detection
    in radar systems. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based method
    for detecting anomalies in radar system data streams. We propose a novel
    technique which learns the correlation between numerical features and an
    embedding representation of categorical features in an unsupervised manner.
    The proposed technique, which allows the detection of malicious
    manipulation of critical fields in the data stream, is complemented by a
    timing-interval anomaly detection mechanism proposed for the detection of
    message dropping attempts. Real radar system data is used to evaluate the
    proposed method. Our experiments demonstrate the method's high detection
    accuracy on a variety of data stream manipulation attacks (average
    detection rate of 88\% with 1.59\% false alarms) and message dropping
    attacks (average detection rate of 92\% with 2.2\% false alarms).},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first publicly available cryptanalytic
    attacks on the GEA-1 and GEA-2 algorithms. Instead of providing full 64-bit
    security, we show that the initial state of GEA-1 can be recovered from as
    little as 65 bits of known keystream (with at least 24 bits coming from one
    frame) in time $2^{40}$ GEA-1 evaluations and using 44.5 GiB of memory. The
    attack on GEA-1 is based on an exceptional interaction of the deployed
    LFSRs and the key initialization, which is highly unlikely to occur by
    chance. This unusual pattern indicates that the weakness is intentionally
    hidden to limit the security level to 40 bit by design.

    In contrast, for GEA-2 we did not discover the same intentional weakness.
    However, using a combination of algebraic techniques and list merging
    algorithms we are still able to break GEA-2 in time $2^{45.1}$ GEA-2
    evaluations. The main practical hurdle is the required knowledge of 1600
    bytes of keystream.},

    research},
  author = {Gernhardt, Dalibor and Gro\v{s}, Stjepan},
  abstract = {Most publicly available data on cyber incidents comes from
    private companies and non-academic sources. Common sources of information
    include various security bulletins, white papers, reports, court cases, and
    blog posts describing specific events, often from a single point of view,
    followed by occasional academic sources, usually conference proceedings.
    The main characteristics of the available data sources are: lack of peer
    review and unavailability of confidential data. In this paper, we use an
    indirect approach to identify trusted sources used in scientific work. We
    analyze how top-rated peer reviewed literature relies on the use of
    non-peer reviewed sources on cybersecurity incidents. To identify current
    non-peer reviewed sources on cybersecurity we analyze references in top
    rated peer reviewed computer security conferences. We also analyze how
    non-peer reviewed sources are used, to motivate or support research. We
    examined 808 articles from top conferences in field of computer security.
    The result of this work are list of the most commonly used non-peer
    reviewed data sources and information about the context in which this data
    is used. Since these sources are accepted in top conferences, other
    researchers can consider them in their future research. To the best of our
    knowledge, analysis on how non-peer reviewed sources are used in
    cyber-security scientific research has not been done before.},

    human activity fields. Technological advances and related ubiquitous
    computerization bring new challenges in this area. In particular, the
    problem concerns the protection of devices against non-invasive acquisition
    processed information in ICT systems. It is known that, e.g., VGA, DVI/HDMI
    interfaces or laser printer formatter systems that process visual signals
    are the effective sources of compromising electromagnetic emanations. The
    emission safety of the more and more commonly used 3D printers is less
    known. In many cases, the disclosure of information about printed objects
    might constitute an infringement of the state/industrial/commercial secret,
    copyright, patent protection, etc. In order to analyze the existing threat,
    a selected printer using FDM technology was tested. During the tests,
    simple objects were printed to identify the operation of the stepper motor
    and the movements of the printer head and the printer platform, which are
    sources of emissions in the secondary channels. The analyses performed
    focused on finding the correlation between the recorded vibration signals
    and the printer head movements when an object was printed. It was shown
    that the analysis of the registered sensitive signal runtimes and their
    spectrograms allowed to recreate the printed object shape. Three simple
    objects (a trihedron, a tube and a tetrahedron) were selected for testing
    because they include elements that allow the four major movements of the
    printer head to be easily recognized: along the X axis, along the Y axis,
    along an arc and diagonally (between the X and Y axes). The paper presents
    the test results and their analyses.},

    to move freely across vertical and inverted surfaces for applications such
    as inspection, exploration, and cleaning. Previous methods for generating
    controllable adhesion have relied on fluidic adhesion through suction
    forces, electromagnetic adhesion through magnetic or electrical
    interactions, or dry fibrillar structures. Herein, a new method for
    achieving controllable adhesion by vibrating a flexible plate near a
    surface, which generates a strong and controllable attraction force, is
    presented. This adhesion mechanism has the unique property of providing
    strong adhesion normal to a surface, but very low resistance to motion
    parallel to the surface, making it attractive for mobile robots. Adhesive
    capabilities of vibration-based adhesion (VBA) to characterize adhesive
    force dependence on vibration frequency and surface size are studied.
    Spatial pressure measurements within the adhesive zone, in combination with
    visualization of surface vibration modes, demonstrate that adhesion is
    localized to the center of the disk and decreases radially. A mobile robot
    to highlight the capabilities and robustness of VBA for payload transport,
    climbing to inversion transitions, and adhesion control is developed.
    Overall, a novel physical mechanism for robot-surface adhesion that is
    robust, controllable, and enables rapid low-friction locomotion is
    presented herein.},

  abstract = {Brain--computer interfaces (BCIs) can restore communication to
    people who have lost the ability to move or speak. So far, a major focus of
    BCI research has been on restoring gross motor skills, such as reaching and
    grasping 1--5 or point-and-click typing with a computer cursor 6,7. However,
    rapid sequences of highly dexterous behaviours, such as handwriting or
    touch typing, might enable faster rates of communication. Here we developed
    an intracortical BCI that decodes attempted handwriting movements from
    neural activity in the motor cortex and translates it to text in real time,
    using a recurrent neural network decoding approach. With this BCI, our
    study participant, whose hand was paralysed from spinal cord injury,
    achieved typing speeds of 90 characters per minute with 94.1\% raw accuracy
    online, and greater than 99\% accuracy offline with a general-purpose
    autocorrect. To our knowledge, these typing speeds exceed those reported
    for any other BCI, and are comparable to typical smartphone typing speeds
    of individuals in the age group of our participant (115 characters per
    minute)8. Finally, theoretical considerations explain why temporally
    complex movements, such as handwriting, may be fundamentally easier to
    decode than point-to-point movements. Our results open a new approach for
    BCIs and demonstrate the feasibility of accurately decoding rapid,
    dexterous movements years after paralysis.},

    the area of cyber-physical security is becoming increasingly important.
    Past research has demonstrated new threat vectors targeting the transition
    process between the cyber and physical domains, where the attacker exploits
    the sensing system as an attack surface for signal injection or extraction
    of private information. Recently, there have been attempts to characterize
    an abstracted model for signal injection, but they primarily focus on the
    path of signal processing. This paper aims to systematize the existing
    research on security and privacy problems arising from the interaction of
    cyber world and physical world, with the context of broad CPS applications.
    The primary goals of the systematization are to (1) reveal the attack
    patterns and extract a general attack model of existing work, (2)
    understand possible new attacks, and (3) motivate development of defenses
    against the emerging cyber-physical threats.},

  abstract = {At a brewery in 1997, an operator confused filling nozzles for
    two commonly used acid cleaning agents and transferred nitric acid into a
    tank with P3, a proprietary phosphoric acid based cleaner that also
    contained 5--15\% isopropanol. 10--15 min later the mixture exploded
    violently. The stainless steel tank disintegrated with such force that
    fragments lodged in walls of concrete. The explosion ravaged the cellar,
    destroyed equipment, blew out a masonry wall and released large amounts of
    nitrous oxide fumes. Likely, 62\% nitric acid (CAS 7697-37-2) and
    isopropanol (2-propanol, CAS 67-63-0) reacted to produce isopropyl nitrate
    (nitric acid 1-methylethyl ester, CAS 1712-64-7), a rocket propellant. It
    is argued that the accident has broad learning potential because of the
    widespread usage of the two chemicals across industries, the innocent
    nature of the human error and the severity of the consequence.

    A review 15 years later of lessons learned finds that information
    dissemination has followed a tradition of informal meetings in small
    industry sector associations but impact is unclear. There is no useful
    mention of the accident in open sources. Although the Danish Working
    Environment Authority took the brewery to court for negligence, they did
    not report or investigate the accident, or attempt to disseminate
    information available to them. Today, the general literature is silent on
    the explosion hazards of mixing the two chemicals.

    The paper argues that without institutional support, learning opportunities
    are missed and broader cross-sector learning is limited or non-existent.},

    respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in humans.
    Despite several emerging vaccines, there remains no verifiable therapeutic
    targeted specifically to the virus. Here we present a highly effective
    siRNA therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection using a novel lipid
    nanoparticle delivery system. Multiple small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
    targeting highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were screened
    and three candidate siRNAs emerged that effectively inhibit virus by
    greater than 90\% either alone or in combination with one another. We
    simultaneously developed and screened two novel lipid nanoparticle
    formulations for the delivery of these candidate siRNA therapeutics to the
    lungs, an organ that incurs immense damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
    Encapsulation of siRNAs in these LNPs followed by in vivo injection
    demonstrated robust repression of virus in the lungs and a pronounced
    survival advantage to the treated mice. Our LNP-siRNA approaches are
    scalable and can be administered upon the first sign of SARS-CoV-2
    infection in humans. We suggest that an siRNA-LNP therapeutic approach
    could prove highly useful in treating COVID-19 disease as an adjunctive
    therapy to current vaccine strategies.},

    punishing effects. (iii) Despite this relative independence, there are,
    undoubtedly, relationships of mutual inhibition existing between these two
    systems. Rewards do, among other things, tend to reduce sensitivity to
    pain, and punishments do tend to reduce rewarding effects. (iv) These
    primary reward systems of the brain are subdivided into specific
    drive-reward subsystems mediating the specific drives such as hunger and
    sex. (v) Because there are also subsystems of this set of rewarding
    structures sensitive to different chemical effects, it is reasonable to
    hope that eventually it will be possible to control the reward systems

    networks in this way is called a bridge. A FreeBSD system with two network
    interfaces is enough in order to act as a bridge.

    A bridge works by scanning the addresses of MAC level (Ethernet addresses)
    of the devices connected to each of its network interfaces and then
    forwarding the traffic between the two networks only if the source and the
    destination are on different segments. Under many points of view a bridge
    is similar to an Ethernet switch with only two ports.},

    the same room, equipped with passive speakers, headphones, or earphones can
    covertly exchange data via ultrasonic waves. Microphones are not required.
    Our method is based on the capability of a malware to exploit a specific
    audio chip feature in order to reverse the connected speakers from output
    devices into input devices---unobtrusively rendering them microphones. We
    discuss the attack model and provide technical background and
    implementation details. We show that although the reversed
    speakers/headphones/earphones were not originally designed to perform as
    microphones, they still respond well to the near-ultrasonic range (18 kHz
    to 24 kHz). We evaluate the communication channel with different equipment,
    and at various distances and transmission speeds, and also discuss some
    practical considerations. Our results show that the speaker-to-speaker
    communication can be used to covertly transmit data between two air-gapped
    computers positioned a maximum of 9 m away from one another. Moreover, we
    show that two (microphone-less) headphones can exchange data from a
    distance of 3 m apart. This enables `headphones-to-headphones' covert
    communication, which is discussed for the first time in this paper.},

    to assess the impact of expanded access to contraception on women's high

    population-representative U.S.\ sample, including large subsamples of young

    contraception was associated with a statistically significant 1.66
    percentage-point increase in high school graduation. This increase in
    graduation represents a 14\% decrease in the baseline percentage not
    graduating high school before the policy change. Results are robust to a
    variety of sensitivity tests. Our findings indicate that improving access
    to contraception increases young women's human capital formation.},

    humanity is facing in the 21st century. In the absence of pharmaceutical
    interventions, physical distancing together with testing, contact tracing

    we show that if testing capacities are limited, containment may fail
    dramatically because such combined countermeasures drastically change the
    rules of the epidemic transition: Instead of continuous, the response to
    countermeasures becomes discontinuous. Rather than following the
    conventional exponential growth, the outbreak that is initially strongly
    sup- pressed eventually accelerates and scales faster than exponential
    during an explosive growth period. As a consequence, containment measures
    either suffice to stop the outbreak at low total case numbers or fail
    catastrophically if marginally too weak, thus implying large uncertainties
    in reliably estimating overall epidemic dynamics, both during initial
    phases and during second wave scenarios.},

  abstract = {We show that the class MIP* of languages that can be decided by
    a classical verifier interacting with multiple all-powerful quantum provers
    sharing entanglement is equal to the class RE of recursively enumerable
    languages. Our proof builds upon the quantum low-degree test of (Natarajan
    and Vidick, FOCS 2018) and the classical low-individual degree test of (Ji,
    et al., 2020) by integrating recent developments from (Natarajan and
    Wright, FOCS 2019) and combining them with the recursive compression
    framework of (Fitzsimons et al., STOC 2019).

    An immediate byproduct of our result is that there is an efficient
    reduction from the Halting Problem to the problem of deciding whether a
    two-player nonlocal game has entangled value 1 or at most 1/2. Using a
    known connection, undecidability of the entangled value implies a negative
    answer to Tsirelson's problem: we show, by providing an explicit example,
    that the closure Cqa of the set of quantum tensor product correlations is
    strictly included in the set Cqc of quantum commuting correlations.
    Following work of (Fritz, \emph{Rev.\ Math.\ Phys.}\ 2012) and (Junge
    {\it et al.}, \emph{J.\ Math.\ Phys.}\ 2011) our results provide a
    refutation of Connes' embedding conjecture from the theory of von Neumann

    Signal from Photovoltaic Modules in Daylight Conditions Using
    Drone-Captured Images},
  abstract = {Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is a powerful technique for
    evaluating the condition of photovoltaic (PV) modules and individual cells.
    While drones are a cheap and practical imaging medium, they present a
    challenge in terms of image stabilization. Flying during daylight hours has
    the advantage of being safer, cheaper, and camera-focus is easier to
    maintain. The main drawback is that sunlight introduces sufficient
    background noise to dominate the EL signal. We present a method for
    automatically tracking and rectifying a PV module in a stack of EL images
    captured by drone in daylight, and subsequently rasterizing the EL signal
    (S/N < 0.1). The method combines feature detection with direct corner
    alignment, and is applicable to any type of drone-based PV-inspection. To
    extract the EL signal, a stabilized image stack is analyzed depth-wise.
    Background noise is calculated and subtracted, and a Fast Fourier Transform
    (FFT) analysis is performed to form an EL amplitude map of the module. The
    analysis is validated by examining adjacent frequencies and by comparison
    with stationary EL. Results show promising image quality that fares well
    compared to stationary EL.},

    They were each type of footwear, athletic shoes of the subjects' choice

    the same three speeds with the subjects wearing shoes and the shoes plus
    lead weights. The weight of the shoes plus the lead weights was equal to
    the weight of the subjects' boots. The VO\textsubscript{2} values with

    alone appeared to account for 48--70\% of the added energy cost of wearing
    boots. The relative energy cost (V0\textsubscript{2}, ml \cdot\
    min\textsuperscript{-1}) of trained and untrained subjects were the same at
    all speeds, but heart rates for the untrained were significantly higher
    ($p<.05) in both shoes and boots excepted the slowest walking speed (4.0
    km\cdot h\textsuperscript{-1}). These data indicate that energy expenditure
    is increased by wearing boots. A large portion of this increase may be
    attributed to weight of footwear. In addition, the increased energy cost of
    locomotion with boots appears to place a limiting stress on untrained
    subjects.},

  abstract = {In this article we develop an algorithm which computes a divisor
    of an integer $N$, which is assumed to be neither prime nor the power of a
    prime. The algorithm uses discrete time heat diffusion on a finite graph.
    If $N$ has $m$ distinct prime factors, then the probability that our
    algorithm runs successfully is at least $p(m)=1-(m+1)/2^m$. We compute the
    computational complexity of the algorithm in terms of classical, or
    digital, steps and in terms of diffusion steps, which is a concept that we
    define here. As we will discuss below, we assert that a diffusion step can
    and should be considered as being comparable to a quantum step for an
    algorithm which runs on a quantum computer. With this, we prove that our
    factorization algorithm uses at most $O((\log N)^2)$ deterministic steps
    and at most $O((\log N)^2)$ diffusion steps with an implied constant which
    is effective. By comparison, Shor's algorithm is known to use at most
    $O((log N)^2\log(log N)\log(\log\log N))$ quantum steps on a quantum
    computer.

    As an example of our algorithm, we simulate the diffusion computer
    algorithm on a desktop computer and obtain factorizations of $N=33$ and
    $N=1363$.},

  author = {Brown, Michael D. and Pruett, Matthew and Bigelow, Robert
    and Mururu, Girish and Pande, Santosh},
  abstract = {Despite extensive testing and correctness certification of their
    functional semantics, a number of compiler optimizations have been shown to
    violate security guarantees implemented in source code. While prior work
    has shed light on how such optimizations may introduce semantic security
    weaknesses into programs, there remains a significant knowledge gap
    concerning the impacts of compiler optimizations on non-semantic properties
    with security implications. In particular, little is currently known about
    how code generation and optimization decisions made by the compiler affect
    the availability and utility of reusable code segments called gadgets
    required for implementing code reuse attack methods such as return-oriented
    programming.

    In this paper, we bridge this gap through a study of the impacts of
    compiler optimization on code reuse gadget populations. We analyze and
    compare 1,187 variants of 20 different benchmark programs built with two
    production compilers (GCC and Clang) to determine how compiler optimization
    behaviors affect the code reuse gadget sets present in program variants
    with respect to both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Our study
    exposes an important and unexpected problem; compiler optimizations
    introduce new gadgets at a high rate and produce optimized code containing
    gadget sets that are generally more useful to an attacker than those in
    unoptimized code.

    Using differential binary analysis, we identify several undesirable
    optimization behaviors at the root of this phenomenon. In turn, we propose
    and evaluate several strategies to mitigate these behaviors. In particular,
    we show that post-production binary recompilation passes can effectively
    mitigate these behaviors with negligible performance impacts, resulting in
    optimized code with significantly smaller and less useful gadget sets.},

  abstract = {The Alcubierre warp drive is an exotic solution in general
    relativity. It allows for superluminal travel at the cost of enormous
    amounts of matter with negative mass density. For this reason, the
    Alcubierre warp drive has been widely considered unphysical. In this study,
    we develop a model of a general warp drive spacetime in classical
    relativity that encloses all existing warp drive definitions and allows for
    new metrics without the most serious issues present in the Alcubierre
    solution. We present the first general model for subluminal
    positive-energy, spherically symmetric warp drives; construct superluminal
    warp-drive solutions which satisfy quantum inequalities; provide
    optimizations for the Alcubierre metric that decrease the negative energy
    requirements by two orders of magnitude; and introduce a warp drive
    spacetime in which space capacity and the rate of time can be chosen in a
    controlled manner. Conceptually, we demonstrate that any warp drive,
    including the Alcubierre drive, is a shell of regular or exotic material
    moving inertially with a certain velocity. Therefore, any warp drive
    requires propulsion. We show that a class of subluminal, spherically
    symmetric warp drive spacetimes, at least in principle, can be constructed
    based on the physical principles known to humanity today.},

  author = {Buhan, Ileana and Batina, Lejla and Yarom, Yuval
    and Schaumont, Patrick},
  abstract = {Side-channel attacks that leak sensitive information through a
    computing device's interaction with its physical environment have proven to
    be a severe threat to devices' security, particularly when adversaries have
    unfettered physical access to the device. Traditional approaches for
    leakage detection measure the physical properties of the device. Hence,
    they cannot be used during the design process and fail to provide root
    cause analysis. An alternative approach that is gaining traction is to
    automate leakage detection by modeling the device. The demand to understand
    the scope, benefits, and limitations of the proposed tools intensifies with
    the increase in the number of proposals.

    In this SoK, we classify approaches to automated leakage detection based on
    the model's source of truth. We classify the existing tools on two main
    parameters: whether the model includes measurements from a concrete device
    and the abstraction level of the device specification used for constructing
    the model. We survey the proposed tools to determine the current knowledge
    level across the domain and identify open problems. In particular, we
    highlight the absence of evaluation methodologies and metrics that would
    compare proposals' effectiveness from across the domain. We believe that
    our results help practitioners who want to use automated leakage detection
    and researchers interested in advancing the knowledge and improving
    automated leakage detection.},

  abstract = {Physical adversarial examples for camera-based computer vision
    have so far been achieved through visible artifacts---a sticker on a Stop
    sign, colorful borders around eyeglasses or a 3D printed object with a
    colorful texture. An implicit assumption here is that the perturbations
    must be visible so that a camera can sense them. By contrast, we contribute
    a procedure to generate, for the first time, physical adversarial examples
    that are invisible to human eyes. Rather than modifying the victim object
    with visible artifacts, we modify light that illuminates the object. We
    demonstrate how an attacker can craft a modulated light signal that
    adversarially illuminates a scene and causes targeted misclassifications on
    a state-of-the-art ImageNet deep learning model. Concretely, we exploit the
    radiometric rolling shutter effect in commodity cameras to create precise
    striping patterns that appear on images. To human eyes, it appears like the
    object is illuminated, but the camera creates an image with stripes that
    will cause ML models to output the attacker-desired classification. We
    conduct a range of simulation and physical experiments with LEDs,
    demonstrating targeted attack rates up to 84\%.},

    be achieved using standard-size tournament-legal decks, and does not rely

    in that all moves of both players are forced in the construction. This
    shows that even recognising who will win a game in which neither player has
    a non-trivial decision to make for the rest of the game is undecidable. We
    conclude with a discussion of the implications for a unified computational
    theory of games and remarks about the playability of such a board in a

  journal = {Future Generation Computer Systems},
  doi = {10.1016/j.future.2021.03.025},
  abstract = {Air-gap covert channels are special types of covert
    communication channels that enable attackers to exfiltrate data from
    isolated, network-less computers. Various types of air-gap covert channels
    have been demonstrated over the years, including electromagnetic, magnetic,
    acoustic, optical, and thermal.

    In this paper, we introduce a new type of vibrational (seismic) covert
    channel. We observe that computers vibrate at a frequency correlated to the
    rotation speed of their internal fans. These inaudible vibrations affect
    the entire structure on which the computer is placed. Our method is based
    on malware's capability of controlling the vibrations generated by a
    computer, by regulating its internal fan speeds. We show that the
    malware-generated covert vibrations can be sensed by nearby smartphones via
    the integrated, sensitive accelerometers. Notably, the accelerometer
    sensors in smartphones can be accessed by any app without requiring the
    user permissions, which make this attack highly evasive. We implemented
    AiR-ViBeR, malware that encodes binary information, and modulate it over a
    low frequency vibrational carrier. The data is then decoded by malicious
    application on a smartphone placed on the same surface of the air-gapped
    computer (e.g., on a desk). We discuss the attack model, provide technical
    background, and present the implementation details and evaluation results.
    Our results show that using AiR-ViBeR, data can be exfiltrated from
    air-gapped computer to a nearby smartphone on the same table, or even an
    adjacent table, via vibrations. Finally, we propose a set of
    countermeasures for this new type of attack.},

  title = {Resist: Reconstruction of irises from templates},
  abstract = {Iris recognition systems transform an iris image into a feature
    vector. The seminal pipeline segments an image into iris and non-iris
    pixels, normalizes this region into a fixed-dimension rectangle, and
    extracts features which are stored and called a template (Daugman, 2009).
    This template is stored on a system. A future reading of an iris can be
    transformed and compared against template vectors to determine or verify
    the identity of an individual. As templates are often stored together, they
    are a valuable target to an attacker. We show how to invert templates
    across a variety of iris recognition systems. That is, we show how to
    transform templates into realistic looking iris images that are also deemed
    as the same iris by the corresponding recognition system. Our inversion is
    based on a convolutional neural network architecture we call RESIST
    (REconStructing IriSes from Templates). We apply RESIST to a traditional
    Gabor filter pipeline, to a DenseNet (Huang et al., CVPR 2017) feature
    extractor, and to a DenseNet architecture that works without normalization.
    Both DenseNet feature extractors are based on the recent ThirdEye
    recognition system (Ahmad and Fuller, BTAS 2019). When training and testing
    using the ND-0405 dataset, reconstructed images demonstrate a rank-1
    accuracy of 100\%, 76\%, and 96\% respectively for the three pipelines. The
    core of our approach is similar to an autoencoder. However, standalone
    training the core produced low accuracy. The final architecture integrates
    into an generative adversarial network (Goodfellow et al., NeurIPS, 2014)
    producing higher accuracy.},

  abstract = {Conventional computers operate deterministically using strings
    of zeros and ones called bits to represent information in binary code.
    Despite the evolution of conventional computers into sophisticated
    machines, there are many classes of problems that they cannot efficiently
    address, including inference, invertible logic, sampling and optimization,
    leading to considerable interest in alternative computing schemes. Quantum
    computing, which uses qubits to represent a superposition of 0 and 1, is
    expected to perform these tasks efficiently 1--3. However, decoherence and
    the current requirement for cryogenic operation4, as well as the limited
    many-body interactions that can be implemented, pose considerable
    challenges. Probabilistic computing 1,5--7 is another unconventional
    computation scheme that shares similar concepts with quantum computing but
    is not limited by the above challenges. The key role is played by a
    probabilistic bit (a p-bit) a robust, classical entity fluctuating in time
    between 0 and 1, which interacts with other p-bits in the same system using
    principles inspired by neural networks8. Here we present a proof-of-concept
    experiment for probabilistic computing using spintronics technology, and
    demonstrate integer factorization, an illustrative example of the
    optimization class of problems addressed by adiabatic9 and gated2 quantum
    computing. Nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions showing stochastic behaviour
    are developed by modifying market-ready magnetoresistive random-access
    memory technology10,11 and are used to implement three-terminal p-bits that
    operate at room temperature. The p-bits are electrically connected to form
    a functional asynchronous network, to which a modified adiabatic quantum
    computing algorithm that implements three- and four-body interactions is
    applied. Factorization of integers up to 945 is demonstrated with this
    rudimentary asynchronous probabilistic computer using eight correlated
    p-bits, and the results show good agreement with theoretical predictions,
    thus providing a potentially scalable hardware approach to the difficult
    problems of optimization and sampling.

    ${\log}$ prototype can be used as an executable model where simulations can

    of a system may result in changes to other parts. Therefore, formal models
    of causality are an attractive tool for reasoning about security, which
    concerns itself with safeguarding properties of a system against
    interventions that may be malicious. As we show, many security properties
    are naturally expressed as nested causal statements: not only do we
    consider what caused a particular undesirable effect, but we also consider
    what caused this causal relationship itself to hold. We present a natural
    way to extend the Halpern-Pearl (HP) framework for causality to capture
    such nested causal statements. This extension adds expressivity, enabling
    the HP framework to distinguish between causal scenarios that it could not
    previously naturally tell apart. We moreover revisit some design decisions
    of the HP framework that were made with non-nested causal statements in
    mind, such as the choice to treat specific values of causal variables as
    opposed to the variables themselves as causes, and may no longer be
    appropriate for nested ones.},

    compatible TCFs, and we propose two new constructions: one based upon the

    and (ii) there exists a natural post-selection scheme, which significantly
    reduces the fidelity needed to demonstrate quantum advantage. Finally, we

    IMEI, hardware serial number, SIM serial number and IMSI, handset phone
    number etc are shared with Apple and Google. Both iOS and Google Android
    transmit telemetry, despite the user explicitly opting out of this. When a
    SIM is inserted both iOS and Google Android send details to Apple/Google.
    iOS sends the MAC addresses of nearby devices, e.g. other handsets and the

    to rapidly develop and deploy offensive techniques that is difficult for
    security products to analyze given these instructions are in bytecode and
    only translated to machine-code by the interpreter immediately prior to
    execution. Our work helps security researchers and enterprise Red Teams who
    play offense. Red Teams want to rapidly prototype malware for their
    periodic campaigns and do not want their malware to be detected by the
    Incident Response (IR) teams prior to accomplishing objectives. Red Teams
    also have difficulty running malware in production from files on disk as
    modern enterprise security products emulate, inspect, or quarantine such
    executables given these files have no reputation. Our work also helps
    enterprise Hunt and IR teams by making them aware of the viability of this
    type of attack. Our approach has been in use in production for over a year

    and began producing electric carbon arc lamps, with which he systematically
    studied the effects of UV on patients suffering from lupus vulgaris, a
    disfiguring skin disease caused by the same bacterium responsible for
    tuberculosis in the lungs. As news spread of Finsen's dramatic success
    rate, so did his technique, and in 1903 he received the Nobel Prize in
    medicine. The use of UV phototherapy waxed and waned over the next century,
    but the current pandemic has renewed interest in UV. Now the emphasis isn't
    on using UV lights to cure those stricken with COVID-19, but on arresting

    This type of malware acts as a form of extortion which encrypts the files
    in a victim's computer and forces the victim to pay the ransom to have the
    data recovered. Even companies and tech savvy people must use extensive
    resources to maintain backups for recovery or else they will lose valuable
    data, not mentioning average users. Unfortunately, not any recovery tool
    can effectively defend various types of ransomware. To address this
    challenge, we propose a novel ransomware defense mechanism that can be
    easily deployed in modern Windows system to recover the data and mitigate a
    ransomware attack. The uniqueness of our approach is to fight the virus
    like a virus. We leverage Alternative Data Streams which are sometimes used
    by malicious applications, to develop a data protection method that

  title = {{Catala}: A Programming Language for the Law},
  cites = {Cited by \cite{Physics2021a}},
  author = {Merigoux, Denis and Chataing, Nicolas and Protzenko, Jonathan},
  abstract = {Law at large underpins modern society, codifying and governing
    many aspects of citizens' daily lives. Oftentimes, law is subject to
    interpretation, debate and challenges throughout various courts and
    jurisdictions. But in some other areas, law leaves little room for
    interpretation, and essentially aims to rigorously describe a computation,
    a decision procedure or, simply said, an algorithm. Unfortunately, prose
    remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job. The lack of formalism
    leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal statutes, with many
    paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages, makes it hard to
    compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a given text; and,
    as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software, the use of
    informal language leaves corner cases unaddressed. We introduce Catala, a
    new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a
    straightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an
    executable implementation. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and
    programmers through a shared medium, which together they can understand,
    edit and evolve, bridging a gap that often results in dramatically
    incorrect implementations of the law. We have implemented a compiler for
    Catala, and have proven the correctness of its core compilation steps using
    the F* proof assistant. We evaluate Catala on several legal texts that are
    algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the US federal income tax
    and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we uncover a bug in
    the official implementation. We observe as a consequence of the
    formalization process that using Catala enables rich interactions between
    lawyers and programmers, leading to a greater understanding of the original
    legislative intent, while producing a correct-by-construction executable
    specification reusable by the greater software ecosystem.},

  author = {Caprolu, Maurantonio and Pontecorvi, Matteo

  abstract = {Bitcoin (BTC) is probably the most transparent payment network
    in the world, thanks to the full history of transactions available to the
    public. Though, Bitcoin is not a fully anonymous environment, rather a
    pseudonymous one, accounting for a number of attempts to beat its
    pseudonimity using clustering techniques. There is, however, a recurring
    assumption in all the cited deanonymization techniques: that each
    transaction output has an address attached to it. That assumption is false.
    An evidence is that, as of block height 591,872, there are several millions
    transactions with at least one output for which the Bitcoin Core client
    cannot infer an address. In this paper, we present a novel approach based
    on sound graph theory for identifying transaction inputs and outputs. Our
    solution implements two simple yet innovative features: it does not rely on
    BTC addresses and explores all the transactions stored in the blockchain.
    All the other existing solutions fail with respect to one or both of the
    cited features. In detail, we first introduce the concept of Unknown
    Transaction and provide a new framework to parse the Bitcoin blockchain by
    taking them into account. Then, we introduce a theoretical model to detect,
    study, and classify---for the first time in the literature---unknown
    transaction patterns in the user network. Further, in an extensive
    experimental campaign, we apply our model to the Bitcoin network to uncover
    hidden transaction patterns within the Bitcoin user network. Results are
    striking: we discovered more than 30,000 unknown transaction DAGs, with a
    few of them exhibiting a complex yet ordered topology and potentially
    connected to automated payment services. To the best of our knowledge, the
    proposed framework is the only one that enables a complete study of the
    unknown transaction patterns, hence enabling further research in the
    fields---for which we provide some directions.},

  title = {Information Signaling: A Counter-Intuitive Defense Against Password
    Cracking},
  author = {Bai, Wenjie and Blocki, Jeremiah and Harsha, Ben},
  abstract = {We introduce password strength information signaling as a novel,
    yet counter-intuitive, defense mechanism against password cracking attacks.
    Recent breaches have exposed billions of user passwords to the dangerous
    threat of offline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker can
    quickly check millions (or sometimes billions/trillions) of password
    guesses by comparing their hash value with the stolen hash from a breached
    authentication server. The attacker is limited only by the resources he is
    willing to invest. Our key idea is to have the authentication server store
    a (noisy) signal about the strength of each user password for an offline
    attacker to find. Surprisingly, we show that the noise distribution for the
    signal can often be tuned so that a rational (profit-maximizing) attacker
    will crack fewer passwords. The signaling scheme exploits the fact that
    password cracking is not a zero-sum game i.e., the attacker's profit is
    given by the value of the cracked passwords minus the total guessing cost.
    Thus, a well-defined signaling strategy will encourage the attacker to
    reduce his guessing costs by cracking fewer passwords. We use an
    evolutionary algorithm to compute the optimal signaling scheme for the
    defender. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our mechanism on several
    password datasets and show that it can reduce the total number of cracked
    passwords by up to 12\% (resp.\ 5\%) of all users in defending against
    offline (resp. online) attacks.},

    that leverage contention on the CPU ring interconnect. There are two
    challenges that make it uniquely difficult to exploit this channel. First,
    little is known about the ring interconnect's functioning and architecture.
    Second, information that can be learned by an attacker through ring
    contention is noisy by nature and has coarse spatial granularity. To
    address the first challenge, we perform a thorough reverse engineering of
    the sophisticated protocols that handle communication on the ring
    interconnect. With this knowledge, we build a cross-core covert channel
    over the ring interconnect with a capacity of over 4 Mbps from a single
    thread, the largest to date for a cross-core channel not relying on shared
    memory. To address the second challenge, we leverage the fine-grained
    temporal patterns of ring contention to infer a victim program's secrets.
    We demonstrate our attack by extracting key bits from vulnerable EdDSA and
    RSA implementations, as well as inferring the precise timing of keystrokes

  abstract = {This paper is a primer on cryptographic accumulators and how to
    apply them practically. A cryptographic accumulator is a space- and
    time-efficient data structure used for set-membership tests. Since it is
    possible to represent any computational problem where the answer is yes or
    no as a set-membership problem, cryptographic accumulators are invaluable
    data structures in computer science and engineering. But, to the best of
    our knowledge, there is neither a concise survey comparing and contrasting
    various types of accumulators nor a guide for how to apply the most
    appropriate one for a given application. Therefore, we address that gap by
    describing cryptographic accumulators while presenting their fundamental
    and so-called optional properties. We discuss the effects of each property
    on the given accumulator's performance in terms of space and time
    complexity, as well as communication overhead.},

  abstract = {To build a universal quantum computer from fragile physical
    qubits, effective implementation of quantum error correction (QEC)1 is an
    essential requirement and a central challenge. Existing demonstrations of
    QEC are based on an active schedule of error-syndrome measurements and
    adaptive recovery operations2,3,4,5,6,7 that are hardware intensive and
    prone to introducing and propagating errors. In principle, QEC can be
    realized autonomously and continuously by tailoring dissipation within the
    quantum system1,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, but so far it has remained challenging
    to achieve the specific form of dissipation required to counter the most
    prominent errors in a physical platform. Here we encode a logical qubit in
    Schr\"{o}dinger cat-like multiphoton states15 of a superconducting cavity,
    and demonstrate a corrective dissipation process that stabilizes an
    error-syndrome operator: the photon number parity. Implemented with
    continuous-wave control fields only, this passive protocol protects the
    quantum information by autonomously correcting single-photon-loss errors
    and boosts the coherence time of the bosonic qubit by over a factor of two.
    Notably, QEC is realized in a modest hardware setup with neither
    high-fidelity readout nor fast digital feedback, in contrast to the
    technological sophistication required for prior QEC demonstrations.
    Compatible with additional phase-stabilization and fault-tolerant
    techniques16,17,18, our experiment suggests quantum dissipation engineering
    as a resource-efficient alternative or supplement to active QEC in future
    quantum computing architectures.},

    we propose a novel attack method called Adversarial Laser Beam (AdvLB),
    which enables manipulation of laser beam's physical parameters to perform
    adversarial attack. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
    proposed approach in both digital- and physical-settings. We further
    empirically analyze the evaluation results and reveal that the proposed
    laser beam attack may lead to some interesting prediction errors of the
    state-of-the-art DNNs. We envisage that the proposed AdvLB method enriches
    the current family of adversarial attacks and builds the foundation for
    future robustness studies for light.},

  abstract = {We present a framework by which websites can coordinate to make
    it difficult for users to set similar passwords at these websites, in an
    effort to break the culture of password reuse on the web today. Though the
    design of such a framework is fraught with risks to users' security and
    privacy, we show that these risks can be effectively mitigated through
    careful scoping of the goals for such a framework and through principled
    design. At the core of our framework is a private set-membership-test
    protocol that enables one website to determine, upon a user setting a
    password for use at it, whether that user has already set a similar
    password at another participating website, but with neither side disclosing
    to the other the password(s) it employs in the protocol. Our framework then
    layers over this protocol a collection of techniques to mitigate the
    leakage necessitated by such a test. We verify via probabilistic model
    checking that these techniques are effective in maintaining account
    security, and since these mechanisms are consistent with common user
    experience today, our framework should be unobtrusive to users who do not
    reuse similar passwords across websites (e.g., due to having adopted a
    password manager). Through a working implementation of our framework and
    optimization of its parameters based on insights of how passwords tend to
    be reused, we show that our design can meet the scalability challenges
    facing such a service.},

    and Myers, Elisha and Ebner, Natalie C.},
  abstract = {Blindspots in APIs can cause software engineers to introduce
    vulnerabilities, but such blindspots are, unfortunately, common. We study
    the effect APIs with blindspots have on developers in two languages by
    replicating an 109-developer, 24-Java-API controlled experiment. Our
    replication applies to Python and involves 129 new developers and 22 new
    APIs. We find that using APIs with blindspots statistically significantly
    reduces the developers' ability to correctly reason about the APIs in both
    languages, but that the effect is more pronounced for Python.
    Interestingly, for Java, the effect increased with complexity of the code
    relying on the API, whereas for Python, the opposite was true. Whether the
    developers considered API uses to be more difficult, less clear, and less
    familiar did not have an effect on their ability to correctly reason about
    them. Developers with better long-term memory recall were more likely to
    correctly reason about APIs with blindspots, but short-term memory,
    processing speed, episodic memory, and memory span had no effect.
    Surprisingly, professional experience and expertice did not improve the
    developers' ability to reason about APIs with blindspots across both
    languages, with long-term professionals with many years of experience
    making mistakes as often as relative novices. Finally, personality traits
    did not significantly affect the Python developers' ability to reason about
    APIs with blindspots, but less extraverted and more open developers were
    better at reasoning about Java APIs with blindspots. Overall, our findings
    suggest that blindspots in APIs are a serious problem across languages, and
    that experience and education alone do not overcome that problem,
    suggesting that tools are needed to help developers recognize blindspots in
    APIs as they write code that uses those APIs.},

  title = {Anti-Counterfeiting for Polymer Banknotes Based on Polymer Substrate
    Fingerprinting},
  author = {Wang, Shen and Toreini, Ehsan and Hao, Feng},
  abstract = {Polymer banknotes are the trend for printed currency and have
    been adopted by more than fifty countries worldwide. However, over the past
    years, the quantity of polymer counterfeits has been increasing, so has the
    quality of counterfeits. This shows that the initial advantage of bringing
    a new polymer technology to fight against counterfeiting is reducing. To
    maintain one step ahead of counterfeiters, we propose a novel
    anti-counterfeiting technique called Polymer Substrate Fingerprinting
    (PSF). Our technique is built based on the observation that the opacity
    coating, a critical step during the production of polymer notes, is a
    stochastic manufacturing process, leaving uneven thickness in the coating
    layer and the random dispersion of impurities from the ink. The
    imperfections in the coating layer result in random translucent patterns
    when a polymer banknote is back-lit by a light source. We show these
    patterns can be reliably captured by a commodity negative-film scanner and
    processed into a compact fingerprint to uniquely identify each banknote.
    Using an extensive dataset of 6,200 sample images collected from 340 UK
    banknotes, we show that our method can reliably authenticate banknotes, and
    is robust against rough daily handling of banknotes. Furthermore, we show
    the extracted fingerprints contain around 900 bits of entropy, which makes
    it extremely scalable to identify every polymer note circulated globally.
    As compared with previous or existing anti-counterfeiting mechanisms for
    banknotes, our method has a distinctive advantage: it ensures that even in
    the extreme case when counterfeiters have procured the same printing
    equipment and ink as used by a legitimate government, counterfeiting
    banknotes remains infeasible because of the difficulty to replicate a
    stochastic manufacturing process.},

    unsupervised access to the mobile sensors' data can result in a multitude
    of side-channel attacks. In this paper, we study potential data leaks from
    Apple Pencil (2nd generation) supported by the Apple iPad Pro, the latest
    stylus pen which attaches to the iPad body magnetically for charging. We
    observe that the Pencil's body affects the magnetic readings sensed by the
    iPad's magnetometer when a user is using the Pencil. Therefore, we ask: Can
    we infer what a user is writing on the iPad screen with the Apple Pencil,
    given access to only the iPad's motion sensors' data? To answer this
    question, we present Side-channel attack on Stylus pencil through Sensors
    (S3), a system that identifies what a user is writing from motion sensor
    readings. We first use the sharp fluctuations in the motion sensors' data
    to determine when a user is writing on the iPad. We then introduce a
    high-dimensional particle filter to track the location and orientation of
    the Pencil during usage. Lastly, to guide particles, we build the Pencil's
    magnetic map serving as a bridge between the measured magnetic data and the
    Pencil location and orientation. We evaluate S3 with 10 subjects and
    demonstrate that we correctly identify 93.9\%, 96\%, 97.9\%, and 93.33\% of

  author = {\v{S}kori\'{c}, Boris and Wolffs, Zef},
  abstract = {Dirac notation is the most common way to describe quantum states
    and operations on states. It is very convenient and allows for quick visual
    distinction between vectors, scalars and operators. For quantum processes
    that involve interactions of multiple systems an even better visualisation
    has been proposed by Coecke and Kissinger, in the form of a diagrammatic
    formalism [CK2017]. Their notation expresses formulas in the form of
    diagrams, somewhat similar to Feynman diagrams, and is more general than
    the circuit notation for quantum computing.

    This document consists of two parts. (1) We give a brief summary of the
    diagrammatic notation of quantum processes, tailored to readers who already
    know quantum physics and are not interested in general process theory. For
    this audience our summary is less daunting than the encyclopaedic book by
    Coecke and Kissinger [CK2017], and on the other hand more accessible than
    the ultra-compact introduction of [KTW2017]. We deviate a somewhat from
    [CK2017,KTW2017] in that we do not assume basis states to equal their own
    complex conjugate; this means that we do not use symmetric notation for
    basis states, and it leads us to explicitly show arrows on wires where they
    are usually omitted.

    (2) We extend the work of Kissinger, Tull and Westerbaan [KTW2017] which
    gives a diagrammatic security proof for BB84 and 6-state Quantum Key
    Distribution. Their proof is based on a sequence of diagrammatic
    manipulations that works when the bases used in the protocol are mutually
    unbiased. We extend this result to 8-state encoding, which has been
    proposed as a tool in quantum key recycling protocols [SdV2017,LS2018], and
    which does not have mutually unbiased bases.},

  abstract = {Overnight, Apple has turned its hundreds-of-million-device
    ecosystem into the world's largest crowd-sourced location tracking network
    called offline finding (OF). OF leverages online finder devices to detect
    the presence of missing offline devices using Bluetooth and report an
    approximate location back to the owner via the Internet. While OF is not
    the first system of its kind, it is the first to commit to strong privacy
    goals. In particular, OF aims to ensure finder anonymity, untrackability of
    owner devices, and confidentiality of location reports. This paper presents
    the first comprehensive security and privacy analysis of OF. To this end,
    we recover the specifications of the closed-source OF protocols by means of
    reverse engineering. We experimentally show that unauthorized access to the
    location reports allows for accurate device tracking and retrieving a
    user's top locations with an error in the order of 10 meters in urban
    areas. While we find that OF's design achieves its privacy goals, we
    discover two distinct design and implementation flaws that can lead to a
    location correlation attack and unauthorized access to the location history
    of the past seven days, which could deanonymize users. Apple has partially
    addressed the issues following our responsible disclosure. Finally, we make
    our research artifacts publicly available.},

  title = {Yoneda Hacking: The Algebra of Attacker Actions},
  author = {Bakirtzis, Georgios and Genovese, Fabrizio and Fleming, Cody H.},
  abstract = {Our work focuses on modeling security of systems from their
    component-level designs. Towards this goal we develop a categorical
    formalism to model attacker actions. Equipping the categorical formalism
    with algebras produces two interesting results for security modeling.
    First, using the Yoneda lemma, we are able to model attacker reconnaissance
    missions. In this context, the Yoneda lemma formally shows us that if two
    system representations, one being complete and the other being the
    attacker's incomplete view, agree at every possible test, then they behave
    the same. The implication is that attackers can still successfully exploit
    the system even with incomplete information. Second, we model the possible
    changes that can occur to the system via an exploit. An exploit either
    manipulates the interactions between system components, for example,
    providing the wrong values to a sensor, or changes the components
    themselves, for example, manipulating the firmware of a global positioning
    system (GPS). One additional benefit of using category theory is that
    mathematical operations can be represented as formal diagrams, which is
    useful for applying this analysis in a model-based design setting. We

  author = {Rahimi, Ali and Maddah-Ali, Mohammad Ali},
  abstract = {Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge
    (zkSNARK) allows a party, known as the prover, to convince another party,
    known as the verifier, that he knows a private value $v$, without revealing
    it, such that $F(u,v)=y$ for some function $F$ and public values $u$ and
    $y$. There are various versions of zk-SNARK, among them, Quadratic
    Arithmetic Program (QAP)-based zk-SNARK has been widely used in practice,
    specially in Blockchain technology. This is attributed to two desirable
    features; its fixed-size proof and the very light computation load of the
    verifier. However, the computation load of the prover in QAP-based
    zkSNARKs, is very heavy, even-though it is designed to be very efficient.
    This load can be beyond the prover's computation power to handle, and has
    to be offloaded to some external servers. In the existing offloading
    solutions, either (i) the load of computation, offloaded to each sever, is
    a fraction of the prover's primary computation (e.g., DZIK), however the
    servers need to be trusted, (ii) the servers are not required to be
    trusted, but the computation complexity imposed to each one is the same as
    the prover's primary computation (e.g., Trinocchio). In this paper, we
    present a scheme, which has the benefits of both solutions. In particular,
    we propose a secure multi-party proof generation algorithm where the prover
    can delegate its task to $N$ servers, where (i) even if a group of
    $T\in \mathbb{N}$ servers, $T\le N$, collude, they cannot gain any
    information about the secret value $v$, (ii) the computation complexity of
    each server is less than $1/(N-T)$ of the prover's primary computation. The
    design is such that we don't lose the efficiency of the prover's algorithm
    in the process of delegating the tasks to external servers.},

    predominately powered by rigid actuators such as piezoelectric ceramics,
    but they have low fracture strength (120 MPa) and failure strain (0.3\%).
    Although these existing systems can achieve a high lift-to-weight ratio,
    they have not demonstrated insect-like maneuvers such as somersault or
    rapid collision recovery. In this article, we present a 665 mg aerial robot
    that is powered by novel dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA). The new DEA
    achieves high power density (1.2 kW/kg) and relatively high transduction
    efficiency (37\%). We further incorporate this soft actuator into an aerial
    robot to demonstrate novel flight capabilities. This insect-scale aerial
    robot has a large lift-to-weight ratio ($>2.2:1$) and it achieves an
    ascending speed of 70 cm/s. In addition to demonstrating controlled
    hovering flight, it can recover from an in-flight collision and perform a
    somersault within 0.16 s. This work demonstrates that soft aerial robots
    can achieve insect-like flight capabilities absent in rigid-powered MAVs,
    thus showing the potential of a new class of hybrid soft-rigid robots.},

    spontaneous Hawking radiation is stationary by observing such a system at
    six different times. Furthermore, we follow the time evolution of Hawking
    radiation and compare and contrast it with predictions for real black
    holes. We observe the ramp-up of Hawking radiation followed by stationary
    spontaneous emission, similar to a real black hole. The end of the
    spontaneous Hawking radiation is marked by the formation of an inner
    horizon, which is seen to cause stimulated Hawking radiation, as predicted.
    We find that the stimulated Hawking and partner particles are directly

    monochromatic. Numerical simulations suggest that
    Bogoliubov--Cherenkov--Landau stimulation predominates, rather than

    increasingly drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the
    industry considers top-performing architectures as intellectual property
    and devotes considerable computational resources to discovering such
    architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). This provides an
    incentive for adversaries to steal these novel architectures; when used in
    the cloud, to provide Machine Learning as a Service, the adversaries also
    have an opportunity to reconstruct the architectures by exploiting a range
    of hardware side channels. However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel
    architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g.,
    the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters
    (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific
    pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an
    algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning
    system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache
    side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace
    of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then
    generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates
    incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We
    implement our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate
    experimentally that we can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing
    pipeline for malware detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network
    architecture for the ImageNet classification optimized to run on CPUs,
    without knowing the architecture family. In both cases, we achieve 0\%
    error. These results suggest hardware side channels are a practical attack
    vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should be devoted to understanding
    their impact on the security of deep learning systems.},

  abstract = {Bitcoin is based on a P2P network that is used to propagate
    transactions and blocks. While the P2P network design intends to hide the
    topology of the P2P network, information about the topology is required to
    understand the network from a scientific point of view. Thus, there is a
    natural tension between the `desire' for unobservability on the one hand,
    and for observability on the other hand. On a middle ground, one would at
    least be interested on some statistical features of the Bitcoin network
    like the number of peers that participate in the propagation of
    transactions and blocks. This number is composed of the number of reachable
    peers that accept incoming connections and unreachable peers that do not
    accept incoming connections. While the number of reachable peers can be
    measured, it is inherently difficult to determine the number of unreachable
    peers. Thus, the number of unreachable peers can only be estimated based on
    some indicators. In this paper, we first define our understanding of
    unreachable peers and then propose the PAL (Passive Announcement Listening)
    method which gives an estimate of the number of unreachable peers by
    observing ADDR messages that announce active IP addresses in the network.
    The PAL method allows for detecting unreachable peers that indicate that
    they provide services useful to the P2P network. In conjunction with
    previous methods, the PAL method can help to get a better estimate of the
    number of unreachable peers. We use the PAL method to analyze data from a
    long-term measurement of the Bitcoin P2P network that gives insights into
    the development of the number of unreachable peers over five years from
    2015 to 2020. Results show that about 31,000 unreachable peers providing
    useful services were active per day at the end of the year 2020. An
    empirical validation indicates that the approach finds about 50 \% of
    unreachable peers that provide useful services.},

    accountant for evaluating $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy
    guarantees using the privacy loss distribution formalism has been shown to
    give tighter bounds than commonly used methods such as R\'{e}nyi accountants
    when applied to compositions of homogeneous mechanisms. This approach is
    also applicable to certain discrete mechanisms that cannot be analysed with
    R\'{e}nyi accountants. In this paper, we extend this approach to
    compositions of heterogeneous mechanisms. We carry out a full error
    analysis that allows choosing the parameters of the algorithm such that a
    desired accuracy is obtained. Using our analysis, we also give a bound for
    the computational complexity in terms of the error which is analogous to
    and slightly tightens the one given by Murtagh and Vadhan (2018). We also
    show how to speed up the evaluation of tight privacy guarantees using the
    Plancherel theorem at the cost of increased pre-computation and memory
    usage.},

    Existing Proof-of-stake (PoS), Proof-of-Space and related protocols are

    adversary nodes come online afterwards, or use additional trust assumptions
    for newly joining nodes.We propose a new PoS protocol PoSAT which can
    provably achieve dynamic availability fully without any additional
    assumptions. The protocol is based on the longest chain and uses a
    Verifiable Delay Function for the block proposal lottery to provide an
    arrow of time. The security analysis of the protocol draws on the recently
    proposed technique of Nakamoto blocks as well as the theory of branching
    random walks. An additional feature of PoSAT is the complete
    unpredictability of who will get to propose a block next, even by the
    winner itself. This unpredictability is at the same level of PoW protocols,
    and is stronger than that of existing PoS protocols using Verifiable Random

  author = {Ma, Fuchen and Fu, Ying and Ren, Meng and Sun, Wanting

  abstract = {The out-of-gas error occurs when smart contract programs are
    provided with inputs that cause excessive gas consumption, and would be
    easily exploited to make the DoS attack. Multiple approaches have been
    proposed to estimate the gas limit of a function in smart contracts to
    avoid such error. However, under estimation often happens when the contract
    is complicated. In this work, we propose V-Gas, which could automatically
    generate inputs that maximizes the gas cost and reduce the under estimation
    cases. V-Gas is designed based on feedback-directed mutational fuzz
    testing. First, V-Gas builds the gas weighted control flow graph (CFG) of
    functions in smart contracts. Then, V-Gas develops gas consumption guided
    selection and mutation strategies to generate the input that maximize the
    gas consumption. For evaluation, we implement V-Gas based on js-evm, a
    widely used ethereum virtual machine written in javascript, and conduct
    experiments on 736 real-world transactions recorded on Ethereum. 44.02\% of
    the transactions would have out-of-gas errors under the estimation results
    given by solc, means that the recorded real gas consumption for those
    recorded transactions is larger than the gas limit value estimated by solc.
    While V-Gas could reduce the under estimation ratio to 13.86\%.
    Furthermore, V-Gas has exposed 25 previously unknown out-of-gas
    vulnerabilities in those widely-used smart contracts, 5 of which have been
    assigned unique CVE identifiers in the US National Vulnerability

    Cybersecurity Gaps in the Military Space Asset Supply Chain},
  author = {Vollmer, Berenike},
  abstract = {The North Atlantic Treaty Organizations (NATO) public-private
    Space Asset Supply Chain (SASC) currently exhibits significant
    cybersecurity gaps. It is well-established that data obtained from space
    assets is fundamental to NATO, as they allow for the facilitation of its
    missions, self-defence and effective deterrence of its adversaries. Any
    hostile cyber operation, suspending control over a space asset, severely
    impacts both NATO missions and allied Member States national security. This
    threat is exacerbated by NATOs mostly unregulated cyber SASC. Hence, this
    thesis answers a twofold research question: a) What are current
    cybersecurity gaps along NATOs global SASC; and b) How can NATO and its
    allied Member States gain greater control over such gaps to safeguard the
    supply of NATO mission-critical information? An ontological field study is
    carried out by conducting nineteen semi-structured interviews with
    high-level representatives from relevant public, private and academic
    organizations. This research was undertaken in collaboration with the NATO
    Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn,
    Estonia. This thesis concludes that current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs
    SASC are caused by cyber vulnerabilities such as legacy systems or the use
    of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology. Inadequate cyber SASC
    management is caused by hindrances such as misaligned classification levels
    and significant understaffing. On this basis, NATO should consider two
    major collaboration initiatives: a) Raising Awareness throughout the whole
    of the NATO system, and b) Pushing forward the creation of regulation
    through a standardized security framework on SASC cybersecurity. Doing so
    would enable NATO and its Member States to recognise cyberthreats to
    mission-critical data early on along its cyber SASC, and thus increase
    transparency, responsibility, and liability.},

  abstract = {The security of modern electronic devices relies on secret keys
    stored on secure hardware modules as the root-of-trust (RoT). Extracting
    those keys would break the security of the entire system. As shown before,
    sophisticated side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks, using chip failure
    analysis (FA) techniques, can extract data from on-chip memory cells.
    However, since the chip's layout is unknown to the adversary in practice,
    secret key localization and reverse engineering are onerous tasks.
    Consequently, hardware vendors commonly believe that the ever-growing
    physical complexity of the integrated circuit (IC) designs can be a natural
    barrier against potential adversaries. In this work, we present a novel
    approach that can extract the secret key without any knowledge of the IC's
    layout, and independent from the employed memory technology as key storage.
    We automate the---traditionally very labor-intensive---reverse
    engineering and data extraction process. To that end, we demonstrate that
    black-box measurements captured using laser-assisted SCA techniques from a
    training device with known key can be used to profile the device for a
    later key prediction on other victim devices with unknown keys. To showcase
    the potential of our approach, we target keys on three different hardware
    platforms, which are utilized as RoT in different products.},

    and routes for the entrance of New World dogs remain uncertain. Here, we
    present a complete mitochondrial genome of a dog from southeast Alaska,
    dated to 10 150 $\pm$ 260 cal BP. We compared this high-coverage genome
    with data from modern dog breeds, historical Arctic dogs and American
    precontact dogs (PCDs) from before European arrival. Our analyses
    demonstrate that the ancient dog belongs to the PCD lineage, which diverged
    from Siberian dogs around 16 700 years ago. This timing roughly coincides
    with the minimum suggested date for the opening of the North Pacific
    coastal (NPC) route along the Cordilleran Ice Sheet and genetic evidence
    for the initial peopling of the Americas. This ancient southeast Alaskan
    dog occupies an early branching position within the PCD clade, indicating
    it represents a close relative of the earliest PCDs that were brought
    alongside people migrating from eastern Beringia southward along the NPC to
    the rest of the Americas. The stable isotope \ce{\delta^{13}C} value of
    this early dog indicates a marine diet, different from the younger
    mid-continent PCDs' terrestrial diet. Although PCDs were largely replaced
    by modern European dog breeds, our results indicate that their population
    decline started approximately 2000 years BP, coinciding with the expansion
    of Inuit peoples, who are associated with traditional sled-dog culture. Our
    findings suggest that dogs formed part of the initial human habitation of
    the New World, and provide insights into their replacement by both Arctic
    and European lineages.},

    parametric oscillators and nonequilibrium condensates operating at the

    efficient analog simulators of the two-local spin Hamiltonians with
    continuous or discrete degrees of freedom. We show that nonequilibrium
    condensates above the threshold arranged in an interacting network may
    realize $k$-local Hamiltonians with $k>2$ and lead to nontrivial phase
    configurations. Similarly, many gain-dissipative systems that can be
    manipulated by optical means can bring about the ground state of the
    $k$-local Hamiltonians and solve higher-order binary optimization problems.
    We show how to facilitate the search for the global solution by invoking
    complex couplings in the system and demonstrate the efficiency of the
    method on the sets of complex problems. This approach offers a highly
    flexible new kind of computation based on gain-dissipative simulators with
    complex coupling switching.},

  author ={Sedlmeir, Johannes and Buhl, Hans Ulrich and Fridgen, Gilbert
    and Keller, Robert},
  abstract = {The enormous power consumption of Bitcoin has led to
    undifferentiated discussions in science and practice about the
    sustainability of blockchain and distributed ledger technology in general.
    However, blockchain technology is far from homogeneous---not only with
    regard to its applications, which now go far beyond cryptocurrencies and
    have reached businesses and the public sector, but also with regard to its
    technical characteristics and, in particular, its power consumption. This
    paper summarizes the status quo of the power consumption of various
    implementations of blockchain technology, with special emphasis on the
    recent `Bitcoin Halving' and so-called `zk-rollups'. We argue that although
    Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains do indeed consume a lot of
    power, alternative blockchain solutions with significantly lower power
    consumption are already available today, and new promising concepts are
    being tested that could further reduce in particular the power consumption
    of large blockchain networks in the near future. From this we conclude that
    although the criticism of Bitcoin's power consumption is legitimate, it
    should not be used to derive an energy problem of blockchain technology in
    general. In many cases in which processes can be digitised or improved with
    the help of more energy-efficient blockchain variants, one can even expect
    net energy savings.},

  author = {Venkatesaramani, Rajagopal and Malin, Bradley A.
    and Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy},
  abstract = {DNA sequencing is becoming increasingly commonplace, both in
    medical and direct-to-consumer settings. To promote discovery, collected
    genomic data is often de-identified and shared, either in public
    repositories, such as OpenSNP, or with researchers through
    access-controlled repositories. However, recent studies have suggested that
    genomic data can be effectively matched to high-resolution
    three-dimensional face images, which raises a concern that the increasingly
    ubiquitous public face images can be linked to shared genomic data, thereby
    re-identifying individuals in the genomic data. While these investigations
    illustrate the possibility of such an attack, they assume that those
    performing the linkage have access to extremely well-curated data. Given
    that this is unlikely to be the case in practice, it calls into question
    the pragmatic nature of the attack. As such, we systematically study this
    re-identification risk from two perspectives: first, we investigate how
    successful such linkage attacks can be when real face images are used, and
    second, we consider how we can empower individuals to have better control
    over the associated re-identification risk. We observe that the true risk
    of re-identification is likely substantially smaller for most individuals
    than prior literature suggests. In addition, we demonstrate that the
    addition of a small amount of carefully crafted noise to images can enable
    a controlled trade-off between re-identification success and the quality of
    shared images, with risk typically significantly lowered even with noise
    that is imperceptible to humans.},

    Consent to Track Users},
  author = {Papadogiannakis, Emmanouil and Papadopoulos, Panagiotis
    and Kourtellis, Nicolas and Markatos, Evangelos P.},
  abstract = {During the past few years, mostly as a result of the GDPR and the
    CCPA, websites have started to present users with cookie consent banners.
    These banners are web forms where the users can state their preference and
    declare which cookies they would like to accept, if such option exists.
    Although requesting consent before storing any identifiable information is
    a good start towards respecting the user privacy, yet previous research has
    shown that websites do not always respect user choices. Furthermore,
    considering the ever decreasing reliance of trackers on cookies and actions
    browser vendors take by blocking or restricting third-party cookies, we
    anticipate a world where stateless tracking emerges, either because
    trackers or websites do not use cookies, or because users simply refuse to
    accept any.

    In this paper, we explore whether websites use more persistent and
    sophisticated forms of tracking in order to track users who said they do
    not want cookies. Such forms of tracking include first-party ID leaking, ID
    synchronization, and browser fingerprinting. Our results suggest that
    websites do use such modern forms of tracking even before users had the
    opportunity to register their choice with respect to cookies. To add insult
    to injury, when users choose to raise their voice and reject all cookies,
    user tracking only intensifies. As a result, users' choices play very
    little role with respect to tracking: we measured that more than 75\% of
    tracking activities happened before users had the opportunity to make a
    selection in the cookie consent banner, or when users chose to reject all
    cookies.},

    Open-Source Software Reuse},
  author = {Woo, Seunghoon and Park, Sunghan and Kim, Seulbae and Lee, Heejoe
    and Oh, Hakjoo},
  abstract = {Open-source software (OSS) is widely reused as it provides
    convenience and efficiency in software development. Despite evident
    benefits, unmanaged OSS components can introduce threats, such as
    vulnerability propagation and license violation. Unfortunately, however,
    identifying reused OSS components is a challenge as the reused OSS is
    predominantly modified and nested. In this paper, we propose CENTRIS, a
    precise and scalable approach for identifying modified OSS reuse. By
    segmenting an OSS code base and detecting the reuse of a unique part of the
    OSS only, CENTRIS is capable of precisely identifying modified OSS reuse in
    the presence of nested OSS components. For scalability, CENTRIS eliminates
    redundant code comparisons and accelerates the search using hash functions.
    When we applied CENTRIS on 10,241 widely-employed GitHub projects,
    comprising 229,326 versions and 80 billion lines of code, we observed that
    modified OSS reuse is a norm in software development, occurring 20 times
    more frequently than exact reuse. Nonetheless, CENTRIS identified reused
    OSS components with 91\% precision and 94\% recall in less than a minute
    per application on average, whereas a recent clone detection technique,
    which does not take into account modified and nested OSS reuse, hardly
    reached 10\% precision and 40\% recall.},

  abstract = {Most computer science conferences rely on paper bidding to assign
    reviewers to papers. Although paper bidding enables high-quality
    assignments in days of unprecedented submission numbers, it also opens the
    door for dishonest reviewers to adversarially influence paper reviewing
    assignments. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some reviewers bid on papers
    by "friends" or colluding authors, even though these papers are outside
    their area of expertise, and recommend them for acceptance without
    considering the merit of the work. In this paper, we study the efficacy of
    such bid manipulation attacks and find that, indeed, they can jeopardize
    the integrity of the review process. We develop a novel approach for paper
    bidding and assignment that is much more robust against such attacks. We
    show empirically that our approach provides robustness even when dishonest
    reviewers collude, have full knowledge of the assignment system's internal
    workings, and have access to the system's inputs. In addition to being more
    robust, the quality of our paper review assignments is comparable to that
    of current, non-robust assignment approaches.},

  author = {Pakdel, Hossein and Fotohi, Reza},
  abstract = {In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), designing a stable, low-power
    routing protocol is a major challenge because successive changes in links
    or breakdowns destabilize the network topology. Therefore, choosing the
    right route in this type of network due to resource constraints and their
    operating environment is one of the most important challenges in these
    networks. Therefore, the main purpose of these networks is to collect
    appropriate routing information about the environment around the network
    sensors while observing the energy consumption of the sensors. One of the
    important approaches to reduce energy consumption in sensor networks is the
    use of the clustering technique, but in most clustering methods, only the
    criterion of the amount of energy of the cluster or the distance of members
    to the cluster has been considered. Therefore, in this paper, a method is
    presented using the firefly algorithm and using the four criteria of
    residual energy, noise rate, number of hops, and distance. The proposed
    method called EM-FIREFLY is introduced which selects the best cluster head
    with high attractiveness and based on the fitness function and transfers
    the data packets through these cluster head to the sink. The proposed
    method is evaluated with NS-2 simulator and compared with the algorithm-PSO
    and optimal clustering methods. The evaluation results show the efficiency
    of the EM-FIREFLY method in maximum relative load and network lifetime
    criteria compared to other methods discussed in this article.},

  abstract = {Aggressive memory density scaling causes modern DRAM devices to
    suffer from RowHammer, a phenomenon where rapidly activating a DRAM row can
    cause bit-flips in physically-nearby rows. Recent studies demonstrate that
    modern DRAM chips, including chips previously marketed as RowHammer-safe,
    are even more vulnerable to RowHammer than older chips. Many works show
    that attackers can exploit RowHammer bit-flips to reliably mount
    system-level attacks to escalate privilege and leak private data.
    Therefore, it is critical to ensure RowHammer-safe operation on all
    DRAM-based systems. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation
    mechanisms face two major challenges. First, they incur increasingly higher
    performance and/or area overheads when applied to more vulnerable DRAM
    chips. Second, they require either proprietary information about or
    modifications to the DRAM chip design. In this paper, we show that it is
    possible to efficiently and scalably prevent RowHammer bit-flips without
    knowledge of or modification to DRAM internals. We introduce BlockHammer, a
    low-cost, effective, and easy-to-adopt RowHammer mitigation mechanism that
    overcomes the two key challenges by selectively throttling memory accesses
    that could otherwise cause RowHammer bit-flips. The key idea of BlockHammer
    is to (1) track row activation rates using area-efficient Bloom filters and
    (2) use the tracking data to ensure that no row is ever activated rapidly
    enough to induce RowHammer bit-flips. By doing so, BlockHammer (1) makes it
    impossible for a RowHammer bit-flip to occur and (2) greatly reduces a
    RowHammer attack's impact on the performance of co-running benign
    applications. Compared to state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms,
    BlockHammer provides competitive performance and energy when the system is
    not under a RowHammer attack and significantly better performance and
    energy when the system is under attack.},

    applications, ranging from gambling games to decentralized finance.
    However, Ethereum is also considered a highly adversarial environment,
    where vulnerable smart contracts will eventually be exploited. Recently,
    Ethereum's pool of pending transaction has become a far more aggressive
    environment. In the hope of making some profit, attackers continuously
    monitor the transaction pool and try to front-run their victims'
    transactions by either displacing or suppressing them, or strategically
    inserting their transactions. This paper aims to shed some light into what
    is known as a dark forest and uncover these predators' actions. We present
    a methodology to efficiently measure the three types of frontrunning:
    displacement, insertion, and suppression. We perform a large-scale analysis
    on more than 11M blocks and identify almost 200K attacks with an
    accumulated profit of 18.41M USD for the attackers, providing evidence that
    frontrunning is both, lucrative and a prevalent issue.},

    Instead of making incremental improvements to existing DV approaches, we
    leverage the observation that existing software fuzzers already provide
    such a solution, and adapt them for hardware DV. Specifically, we translate
    RTL hardware to a software model and fuzz that model. The central challenge
    we address is how best to mitigate the differences between the hardware
    execution model and software execution model. This includes: 1) how to
    represent test cases, 2) what is the hardware equivalent of a crash, 3)
    what is an appropriate coverage metric, and 4) how to create a
    general-purpose fuzzing harness for hardware.

    To evaluate our approach, we fuzz four IP blocks from Google's OpenTitan
    SoC. Our experiments reveal a two orders-of-magnitude reduction in run time
    to achieve Finite State Machine (FSM) coverage over traditional dynamic
    verification schemes. Moreover, with our design-agnostic harness, we
    achieve over 88\% HDL line coverage in three out of four of our
    designs---even without any initial seeds.},

  title = {A Historical and Statistical Study of the Software Vulnerability
    Landscape},
  author = {Gueye, Assane and Mell, Peter},
  abstract = {Understanding the landscape of software vulnerabilities is key
    for developing effective security solutions. Fortunately, the evaluation of
    vulnerability databases that use a framework for communicating
    vulnerability attributes and their severity scores, such as the Common
    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), can help shed light on the nature of
    publicly published vulnerabilities. In this paper, we characterize the
    software vulnerability landscape by performing a historical and statistical
    analysis of CVSS vulnerability metrics over the period of 2005 to 2019
    through using data from the National Vulnerability Database. We conduct
    three studies analyzing the following: the distribution of CVSS scores
    (both empirical and theoretical), the distribution of CVSS metric values
    and how vulnerability characteristics change over time, and the relative
    rankings of the most frequent metric value over time. Our resulting
    analysis shows that the vulnerability threat landscape has been dominated
    by only a few vulnerability types and has changed little during the time
    period of the study. The overwhelming majority of vulnerabilities are
    exploitable over the network. The complexity to successfully exploit these
    vulnerabilities is dominantly low; very little authentication to the target
    victim is necessary for a successful attack. And most of the flaws require
    very limited interaction with users. However on the positive side, the
    damage of these vulnerabilities is mostly confined within the security
    scope of the impacted components. A discussion of lessons that could be
    learned from this analysis is presented.},

    cloud-based LaTeX editors and services compiling LaTeX sources are

    collects system data and hides them inside the PDF file produced by the
    target. Then, we have measured what can be recovered by hackers using
    malicious LaTeX file on online services, and which measures those services
    have enforced to thwart the threats. Services defend themselves using

    to setup and we found one service (PMLatex) which is too permissive.},

    begun to reveal the population histories of both people and dogs. Over the
    last 10,000 y, the genetic signatures of ancient dog remains have been
    linked with known human dispersals in regions such as the Arctic and the
    remote Pacific. It is suspected, however, that this relationship has a much
    deeper antiquity, and that the tandem movement of people and dogs may have
    begun soon after the domestication of the dog from a gray wolf ancestor in
    the late Pleistocene. Here, by comparing population genetic results of
    humans and dogs from Siberia, Beringia, and North America, we show that
    there is a close correlation in the movement and divergences of their
    respective lineages. This evidence places constraints on when and where dog
    domestication took place. Most significantly, it suggests that dogs were
    domesticated in Siberia by \~23,000 y ago, possibly while both people and
    wolves were isolated during the harsh climate of the Last Glacial Maximum.
    Dogs then accompanied the first people into the Americas and traveled with
    them as humans rapidly dispersed into the continent beginning \~15,000 y

  abstract = {Cameras have become a fundamental component of vision-based
    intelligent systems. As a balance between production costs and image
    quality, most modern cameras use Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor
    image sensors that implement an electronic rolling shutter mechanism, where
    image rows are captured consecutively rather than all-at-once.

    In this paper, we describe how the electronic rolling shutter can be
    exploited using a bright, modulated light source (e.g., an inexpensive,
    off-the-shelf laser), to inject fine-grained image disruptions. These
    disruptions substantially affect camera-based computer vision systems,
    where high-frequency data is crucial in extracting informative features
    from objects.

    We study the fundamental factors affecting a rolling shutter attack, such
    as environmental conditions, angle of the incident light, laser to camera
    distance, and aiming precision. We demonstrate how these factors affect the
    intensity of the injected distortion and how an adversary can take them
    into account by modeling the properties of the camera. We introduce a
    general pipeline of a practical attack, which consists of: (i) profiling
    several properties of the target camera and (ii) partially simulating the
    attack to find distortions that satisfy the adversary's goal. Then, we
    instantiate the attack to the scenario of object detection, where the
    adversary's goal is to maximally disrupt the detection of objects in the
    image. We show that the adversary can modulate the laser to hide up to 75\%
    of objects perceived by state-of-the-art detectors while controlling the
    amount of perturbation to keep the attack inconspicuous. Our results
    indicate that rolling shutter attacks can substantially reduce the
    performance and reliability of vision-based intelligent systems.},

    ({DDC})---Countering Trojan Horse attacks on Compilers},
  abstract = {An Air Force evaluation of Multics, and Ken Thompson's Turing
    award lecture (``Reflections on Trusting Trust''), showed that compilers
    can be subverted to insert malicious Trojan horses into critical software,
    including themselves. If this ``trusting trust'' attack goes undetected,
    even complete analysis of a system's source code will not find the
    malicious code that is running. Previously-known countermeasures have been
    grossly inadequate. If this attack cannot be countered, attackers can
    quietly subvert entire classes of computer systems, gaining complete
    control over financial, infrastructure, military, and/or business system
    infrastructures worldwide. This dissertation's thesis is that the trusting
    trust attack can be detected and effectively countered using the ``Diverse
    Double-Compiling'' (DDC) technique, as demonstrated by (1) a formal proof
    that DDC can determine if source code and generated executable code
    correspond, (2) a demonstration of DDC with four compilers (a small C
    compiler, a small Lisp compiler, a small maliciously corrupted Lisp
    compiler, and a large industrial-strength C compiler, GCC), and (3) a
    description of approaches for applying DDC in various real-world scenarios.
    In the DDC technique, source code is compiled twice: once with a second
    (trusted) compiler (using the source code of the compiler's parent), and
    then the compiler source code is compiled using the result of the first
    compilation. If the result is bit-for-bit identical with the untrusted
    executable, then the source code accurately represents the executable.},

  abstract = {Secure applications implement software protections against
    side-channel and physical attacks. Such protections are meaningful at

    altering the protection, security engineers embed input/output side-effects
    into the protection. These side-effects are error-prone and

    generated machine code to make sure security or privacy properties are
    still enforced. Vu et al.\ recently demonstrated how to automate the
    insertion of volatile side-effects in a compiler [52], but these may be
    too expensive in fined-grained protections such as control-flow integrity.
    We introduce observations of the program state that are intrinsic to the
    correct execution of security protections, along with means to specify and
    preserve observations across the compilation flow. Such observations
    complement the traditional input/output-preservation contract of compilers.
    We show how to guarantee their preservation without modifying compilation
    passes and with as little performance impact as possible. We validate our
    approach on a range of benchmarks, expressing the secure compilation of
    these applications in terms of observations to be made at specific program
    points.},

  month = {18 January},
  abstract = {Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows a third party to
    perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data, learning neither the
    inputs nor the computation results. Hence, it provides resilience in
    situations where computations are carried out by an untrusted or
    potentially compromised party. This powerful concept was first conceived by
    Rivest et al.\ in the 1970s. However, it remained unrealized until Craig
    Gentry presented the first feasible FHE scheme in 2009.

    The advent of the massive collection of sensitive data in cloud services,
    coupled with a plague of data breaches, moved highly regulated businesses
    to increasingly demand confidential and secure computing solutions. This
    demand, in turn, has led to a recent surge in the development of FHE tools.
    To understand the landscape of recent FHE tool developments, we conduct an
    extensive survey and experimental evaluation to explore the current state
    of the art and identify areas for future development.

    In this paper, we survey, evaluate, and systematize FHE tools and
    compilers. We perform experiments to evaluate these tools' performance and
    usability aspects on a variety of applications. We conclude with
    recommendations for developers intending to develop FHE-based applications
    and a discussion on future directions for FHE tools development.},

  abstract = {While deep neural networks show unprecedented performance in
    various tasks, the vulnerability to adversarial examples hinders their
    deployment in safety-critical systems. Many studies have shown that attacks
    are also possible even in a black-box setting where an adversary cannot
    access the target model's internal information. Most black-box attacks are
    based on queries, each of which obtains the target model's output for an
    input, and many recent studies focus on reducing the number of required
    queries. In this paper, we pay attention to an implicit assumption of these
    attacks that the target model's output exactly corresponds to the query
    input. If some randomness is introduced into the model to break this
    assumption, query-based attacks may have tremendous difficulty in both
    gradient estimation and local search, which are the core of their attack
    process. From this motivation, we observe even a small additive input noise
    can neutralize most query-based attacks and name this simple yet effective
    approach Small Noise Defense (SND). We analyze how SND can defend against
    query-based black-box attacks and demonstrate its effectiveness against
    eight different state-of-the-art attacks with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
    datasets. Even with strong defense ability, SND almost maintains the
    original clean accuracy and computational speed. SND is readily applicable
    to pre-trained models by adding only one line of code at the inference
    stage, so we hope that it will be used as a baseline of defense against
    query-based black-box attacks in the future.},

    widespread large carnivores in Pleistocene America1, yet relatively little
    is known about their evolution or extinction. Here, to reconstruct the
    evolutionary history of dire wolves, we sequenced five genomes from
    sub-fossil remains dating from 13,000 to more than 50,000 years ago. Our
    results indicate that although they were similar morphologically to the
    extant grey wolf, dire wolves were a highly divergent lineage that split
    from living canids around 5.7 million years ago. In contrast to numerous
    examples of hybridization across Canidae2,3, there is no evidence for gene
    flow between dire wolves and either North American grey wolves or coyotes.
    This suggests that dire wolves evolved in isolation from the Pleistocene
    ancestors of these species. Our results also support an early New World
    origin of dire wolves, while the ancestors of grey wolves, coyotes and
    dholes evolved in Eurasia and colonized North America only relatively
    recently.},

    using femtosecond lasers. A high-intensity laser excites physical matter to
    emit light at an arbitrary three-dimensional position. Popular applications
    can thus be explored, especially because plasma induced by a femtosecond
    laser is less harmful than that generated by a nanosecond laser. There are
    two methods of rendering graphics with a femtosecond laser in air:
    producing holograms using spatial light modulation technology and scanning
    of a laser beam by a galvano mirror. The holograms and workspace of the
    system proposed here occupy a volume of up to \SI{1}{\cubic\centi\metre};
    however, this size is scalable depending on the optical devices and their
    setup. This article provides details of the principles, system setup, and
    experimental evaluation, and discusses the scalability, design space, and
    applications of this system. We tested two laser sources: an adjustable
    (30--\SI{100}{\femto\second}) laser that projects up to 1,000 pulses/s at
    an energy of up to \SI{7}{\milli\joule}/pulse and a \SI{269}{\femto\second}
    laser that projects up to 200,000 pulses/s at an energy of up to
    \SI{50}{\micro\joule}/pulse. We confirmed that the spatiotemporal
    resolution of volumetric displays implemented using these laser sources is
    4,000 and 200,000 dots/s, respectively. Although we focus on laser-induced
    plasma in air, the discussion presented here is also applicable to other
    rendering principles such as fluorescence and microbubbles in solid or
    liquid materials.},

    field with two ultra-intense laser beams form a double-slit interference
    pattern. Such electromagnetic fields are predicted to induce material-like
    behaviour in vacuum, supporting elastic scattering between photons. Our
    double-slit scenario presents, on the one hand, a realizable method
    with which to observe photon--photon scattering and, on the other hand,
    demonstrates the possibility of both controlling light with light and

    brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have advanced rapidly, partly due to
    deeper understanding of the brain and wide adoption of sophisticated
    machine learning approaches for decoding the EEG signals. However, recent
    studies have shown that machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to
    adversarial attacks. This article proposes to use narrow period pulse for
    poisoning attack of EEG-based BCIs, which is implementable in practice and
    has never been considered before. One can create dangerous backdoors in the
    machine learning model by injecting poisoning samples into the training
    set. Test samples with the backdoor key will then be classified into the
    target class specified by the attacker. What most distinguishes our
    approach from previous ones is that the backdoor key does not need to be
    synchronized with the EEG trials, making it very easy to implement. The
    effectiveness and robustness of the backdoor attack approach is
    demonstrated, highlighting a critical security concern for EEG-based BCIs
    and calling for urgent attention to address it.},

    symbol systems, such as formal logic and symbolic math such as algebra.
    Expert programmers (average 11 years of programming experience) performed
    code comprehension and memory control tasks while undergoing fMRI. The same
    participants also performed formal logic, symbolic math, executive control,
    and language localizer tasks. A left-lateralized fronto-parietal network
    was recruited for code comprehension. Patterns of activity within this
    network distinguish between `for' loops and `if' conditional code
    functions. In terms of the underlying neural basis, code comprehension
    overlapped extensively with formal logic and to a lesser degree math.
    Overlap with executive processes and language was low, but laterality of
    language and code covaried across individuals. Cultural symbol systems,
    including code, depend on a distinctive fronto-parietal cortical network.},

  abstract = {Voters are understandably concerned about election security. News
    reports of possible election interference by foreign powers, of
    unauthorized voting, of voter disenfranchisement, and of technological
    failures call into question the integrity of elections worldwide. This
    article examines the suggestions that ``voting over the Internet'' or
    ``voting on the blockchain'' would increase election security, and finds
    such claims to be wanting and misleading. While current election systems
    are far from perfect, Internet- and blockchain-based voting would greatly
    increase the risk of undetectable, nation-scale election failures.Online
    voting may seem appealing: voting from a computer or smart phone may seem
    convenient and accessible. However, studies have been inconclusive, showing
    that online voting may have little to no effect on turnout in practice, and
    it may even increase disenfranchisement. More importantly: given the
    current state of computer security, any turnout increase derived from with
    Internet- or blockchain-based voting would come at the cost of losing
    meaningful assurance that votes have been counted as they were cast, and
    not undetectably altered or discarded. This state of affairs will continue
    as long as standard tactics such as malware, zero days, and
    denial-of-service attacks continue to be effective. This article analyzes
    and systematizes prior research on the security risks of online and
    electronic voting, and show that not only do these risks persist in
    blockchain-based voting systems, but blockchains may introduce additional
    problems for voting systems. Finally, we suggest questions for critically
    assessing security risks of new voting system proposals.},

    demonstrate that quantum coherence generated in the energy eigenbasis of a
    system undergoing a finite-time information erasure protocol yields rare
    events with extreme dissipation. These fluctuations are of purely quantum
    origin. By studying the full statistics of the dissipated heat in the
    slow-driving limit, we prove that coherence provides a non-negative
    contribution to all statistical cumulants. Using the simple and
    paradigmatic example of single bit erasure, we show that these extreme

  abstract = {Power side-channel analysis (SCA) has been of immense interest to
    most embedded designers to evaluate the physical security of the system.
    This work presents profiling-based cross-device power SCA attacks using
    deep-learning techniques on 8-bit AVR microcontroller devices running
    AES-128. First, we show the practical issues that arise in these
    profiling-based cross-device attacks due to significant device-to-device
    variations. Second, we show that utilizing principal component analysis
    (PCA)-based preprocessing and multidevice training, a multilayer perceptron
    (MLP)-based 256-class classifier can achieve an average accuracy of
    $99.43\%$ in recovering the first keybyte from all the 30 devices in our
    data set, even in the presence of significant interdevice variations.
    Results show that the designed MLP with PCA-based preprocessing outperforms
    a convolutional neural network (CNN) with four-device training by $\sim
    20\%$ in terms of the average test accuracy of cross-device attack for the
    aligned traces captured using the ChipWhisperer hardware. Finally, to
    extend the practicality of these cross-device attacks, another
    preprocessing step, namely, dynamic time warping (DTW) has been utilized to
    remove any misalignment among the traces, before performing PCA. DTW along
    with PCA followed by the 256-class MLP classifier provides $\ge 10.97\%$
    higher accuracy than the CNN-based approach for cross-device attack even in
    the presence of up to 50 time-sample misalignments between the traces.},

    high dropout rates. Recent research suggests that self-efficacy---an
    individual's belief in their ability to complete a task---can influence
    whether students decide to persist in CS. Studies show that students'
    self-assessments affect their self-efficacy in many domains, and in CS,
    researchers have found that students frequently assess their programming
    ability based on their expectations about the programming process. However,
    we know little about the specific programming experiences that prompt the
    negative self-assessments that lead to lower self-efficacy. In this paper,
    we present findings from a survey study with 214 CS1 students from three
    universities. We used vignette-style questions to describe thirteen
    programming moments which may prompt negative self-assessments, such as
    getting syntax errors and spending time planning. We found that many
    students across all three universities reported that they negatively
    self-assess at each of the thirteen moments, despite the differences in
    curriculum and population. Furthermore, those who report more frequent
    negative self-assessments tend to have lower self-efficacy. Finally, our
    findings suggest that students' perceptions of professional programming
    practice may influence their expectations and negative self-assessments. By
    reducing the frequency that students self-assess negatively while
    programming, we may be able to improve self-efficacy and decrease dropout
    rates in CS.},

    reported that the implementation choices in cryptographic libraries allow

    technique to two new scenarios when not only public but also private keys
    are available for the origin attribution - analysis of a source of
    GCD-factorable keys in IPv4-wide TLS scans and forensic investigation of an
    unknown source. We learn several representatives of the bias from the
    private keys to train a model on more than 150 million keys collected from
    70 cryptographic libraries, hardware security modules and cryptographic
    smartcards. Our model not only doubles the number of distinguishable groups
    of libraries (compared to public keys from Svenda et al.) but also improves
    more than twice in accuracy w.r.t. random guessing when a single key is
    classified. For a forensic scenario where at least 10 keys from the same
    source are available, the correct origin library is correctly identified
    with average accuracy of 89\% compared to 4\% accuracy of a random guess.
    The technique was also used to identify libraries producing GCD-factorable
    TLS keys, showing that only three groups are the probable suspects.},

  abstract = {Currently, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has caused
    catastrophic effect on every aspect of our lives, globally. The entire
    human race of all countries and regions has suffered devastating losses.
    With its high infectiousness and mortality rate, it is of great
    significance to carry out effective precautions and prevention of COVID-19.
    Specifically, transportation system has been confirmed as one of the
    crucial spreading routes. Hence, enhancing healthcare monitoring and
    infection tracking for high-mobility transportation system is infeasible
    for pandemic control. Meanwhile, due to the promising advantages in the
    emerging intelligent transportation system (ITS), vehicular ad hoc networks
    (VANETs) is able to collect and process relevant vehicular data for
    improving the driving experience and road safety, which provide a way for
    non-contact automatic healthcare monitoring. Furthermore, the proliferating
    cloud computing and blockchain techniques enables sufficient processing and
    storing capabilities, along with decentralized remote auditing towards
    heterogenous vehicular data. In this case, the automated infection tracking
    for pandemic control could be achieved accordingly. For the above
    consideration, in this paper we develop a practical homomorphic
    authentication scheme for cloud-assisted VANETs, where the healthcare
    monitoring for all involving passengers is provided. Notably, the
    cloud-assisted VANET infrastructure is utilized, where the hybrid medical
    data acquisition module is attached. In this way, timely non-contact
    measurement on all passengers' physical conditions can be remotely done by
    vehicular cloud (VC), which could drastically improve the efficiency and
    guarantee safety as well. Vulnerabilities of the employed
    dedicated-short-range-communication (DSRC) technique could be fully
    addressed with the applied homomorphic encryption design. Additionally, the
    decentralized blockchain-based vehicle recording mechanism is cooperatively
    performed by VC and edge units. Historical infection tracking on specific
    vehicle and individual can be offered in this way. Each signature sequence
    is collaboratively maintained and verified by the current roadside unit
    (RSU) and its neighbor RSUs. Formal security analysis demonstrates that the
    proposed scheme is secure against major attacks, while the performance
    comparison with the state-of-the-arts relevant methods are presented for
    efficiency discussion.},

    to be non Poisson distributed, so involving some large scale correlation
    mechanism, which could be internal or external to the Earth. Till now, no
    statistically significant correlation of the global seismicity with one of
    the possible mechanisms has been demonstrated yet. In this paper, we
    analyze 20 years of proton density and velocity data, as recorded by the
    SOHO satellite, and the worldwide seismicity in the corresponding
    period, as reported by the ISC-GEM catalogue. We found clear correlation
    between proton density and the occurrence of large earthquakes ($M>5.6$),
    with a time shift of one day. The significance of such correlation is very
    high, with probability to be wrong lower than $10^-5$. The correlation
    increases with the magnitude threshold of the seismic catalogue. A
    tentative model explaining such a correlation is also proposed, in terms of
    the reverse piezoelectric effect induced by the applied electric
    field related to the proton density. This result opens new perspectives in
    seismological interpretations, as well as in earthquake forecast.},

    analysis of PowerHammer---an attack that uses power lines to exfiltrate
    data from air-gapped computers. A malicious code running on a compromised
    computer intentionally controls the utilization of the CPU cores. The CPU
    utilization is electromagnetically conducted and propagated through the
    power lines in the form of a parasitic signal that is modulated, encoded,
    and transmitted on top of the current flow fluctuations. This
    electromagnetic phenomenon is known as `conducted emission'. In this
    attack, the attacker taps the indoor electrical power wiring that is
    connected to the electrical outlet of the compromised computer. The
    conducted electromagnetic emission of the compromised computer is analyzed
    and the exfiltrated data is decoded. The proposed attack is then
    experimentally evaluated and characterized. The communication performance
    is discussed and a set of defensive countermeasures is presented. A crucial
    aspect of the proposed covert communication scheme is that it fully
    conforms to civilian and military conductive emission standards.},

    user on popular web search engines is a significant threat to user privacy.
    This threat has received surprisingly little attention in the network
    traffic analysis literature. In this work, we consider the problem of
    keyword fingerprinting of HTTPS traffic---we study the impact of several
    factors, including client platform diversity, choice of search engine,
    feature sets as well as classification frameworks. We conduct both
    closed-world and open-world evaluations using nearly 4 million search
    queries collected over a period of three months. Our analysis reveals
    several insights into the threat of keyword fingerprinting in modern HTTPS

  abstract = {The bright supergiant, Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis, HD 39801)
    experienced a visual dimming during 2019 December and the first quarter of
    2020 reaching an historic minimum 2020 February 7--13. During 2019
    September--November, prior to the optical dimming event, the photosphere
    was expanding. At the same time, spatially resolved ultraviolet spectra
    using the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
    revealed a substantial increase in the ultraviolet spectrum and Mg II line
    emission from the chromosphere over the southern hemisphere of the star.
    Moreover, the temperature and electron density inferred from the spectrum
    and C II diagnostics also increased in this hemisphere. These changes
    happened prior to the Great Dimming Event. Variations in the Mg II k-line
    profiles suggest material moved outwards in response to the passage of a
    pulse or acoustic shock from 2019 September through 2019 November. It
    appears that this extraordinary outflow of material from the star, likely
    initiated by convective photospheric elements, was enhanced by the
    coincidence with the outward motions in this phase of the $\sim 400$ day
    pulsation cycle. These ultraviolet observations appear to provide the
    connecting link between the known large convective cells in the photosphere
    and the mass ejection event that cooled to form the dust cloud in the
    southern hemisphere imaged in 2019 December, and led to the exceptional
    optical dimming of Betelgeuse in 2020 February.},

    Hubble Space Telescope's STIS spectrograph to obtain the first near-UV
    (1700--\SI{3200}{\angstrom}) observation of Earth as a transiting
    exoplanet. The observatories and instruments that will be able to perform
    transmission spectroscopy of exo-Earths are beginning to be planned, and
    characterizing the transmission spectrum of Earth is vital to ensuring that
    key spectral features (e.g., ozone, or \ce{O3}) are appropriately captured
    in mission concept studies. \ce{O3} is photochemically produced from
    \ce{O2}, a product of the dominant metabolism on Earth today, and it will
    be sought in future observations as critical evidence for life on
    exoplanets. Ground-based observations of lunar eclipses have provided the
    Earth's transmission spectrum at optical and near-IR wavelengths, but the
    strongest \ce{O3} signatures are in the near-UV. We describe the
    observations and methods used to extract a transmission spectrum from
    Hubble lunar eclipse spectra, and identify spectral features of \ce{O3} and
    Rayleigh scattering in the 3000--\SI{5500}{\angstrom} region in Earth's
    transmission spectrum by comparing to Earth models that include refraction
    effects in the terrestrial atmosphere during a lunar eclipse. Our near-UV
    spectra are featureless, a consequence of missing the narrow time span
    during the eclipse when near-UV sunlight is not completely attenuated
    through Earth's atmosphere due to extremely strong \ce{O3} absorption and
    when sunlight is transmitted to the lunar surface at altitudes where it
    passes through the \ce{O3} layer rather than above it.},

  abstract = {Agentic self-enhancement consists of self-protective and
    self-advancing tendencies that can lead to aggression, especially when
    challenged. Because self-enhancers often endorse aggression to defend or
    enhance the self-concept, religious self-enhancement should lead to
    endorsing aggression to defend or enhance one's religion. We recruited
    three samples ($N=969$) from Mechanical Turk ($n=409$), Iran ($n=351$), and
    the U.S.--Mexico border region ($n=209$). We found that religious (but not
    secular) self-enhancement in the form of religious overclaiming predicted
    support for, and willingness to engage in, religious aggression. In
    contrast, accuracy in religious knowledge had mostly negative associations
    with aggression-relevant outcomes. These results emerged across two
    separate religions (Christianity and Islam) and across three different
    cultures (the United States, Iran, and the U.S.--Mexico border region).
    Thus, religious overclaiming is a promising new direction for studying
    support for religious aggression and identifying those who may become
    aggressive in the name of God.},

  abstract = {In 2012, a survey research was publicized suggesting that
    Fox News viewers were not only less informed than consumers of other news
    media but also less informed than people abstaining from news media
    entirely. Many have taken this to be unequivocally true and the study
    remains popular among political discussants to this day. However, virtually
    all of the investigations used to advance the argument focus on current
    events type knowledge and neglect important controls that could influence
    both political knowledge and Fox News consumption. Furthermore, no research
    to date has investigated any effects stemming from consuming the network's
    online content (i.e., from foxnews.com). This article aims to contribute
    these gaps. Using the 2016 American National Election Survey (ANES), I
    investigate whether consuming content from foxnews.com is associated with
    decreased political knowledge. I find no differences in knowledge
    concerning how the U.S. political system works (what I call process-related
    knowledge) but do find a significant, negative relationship between
    visiting foxnews.com and facts about society writ large (what I call
    society-oriented knowledge). These effects persist even when controlling
    for party, ideology, and conservative-group affinity and in the
    preponderance of matching procedures employed to reduce concerns of
    self-selection. Implications and avenues of future research are also
    discussed.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is today commonly employed in the Financial
    Services Sector (FSS) to create various models to predict a variety of
    conditions ranging from financial transactions fraud to outcomes of
    investments and also targeted marketing campaigns. The common ML technique
    used for the modeling is supervised learning using regression algorithms
    and usually involves large amounts of data that needs to be shared and
    prepared before the actual learning phase. Compliance with privacy laws and
    confidentiality regulations requires that most, if not all, of the data
    must be kept in a secure environment, usually in-house, and not outsourced
    to cloud or multi-tenant shared environments. This paper presents the
    results of a research collaboration between IBM Research and Banco Bradesco
    SA to investigate approaches to homomorphically secure a typical ML
    pipeline commonly employed in the FSS industry. We investigated and
    deconstructed a typical ML pipeline used by Banco Bradesco and applied
    Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to two of the important ML tasks, namely the
    variable selection phase of the model generation task and the prediction
    task. Variable selection, which usually precedes the training phase, is
    very important when working with data sets for which no prior knowledge of
    the covariate set exists. Our work provides a way to define an initial
    covariate set for the training phase while preserving the privacy and
    confidentiality of the input data sets. Quality metrics, using real
    financial data, comprising quantitative, qualitative and categorical
    features, demonstrated that our HE based pipeline can yield results
    comparable to state of the art variable selection techniques and the
    performance results demonstrated that HE technology has reached the
    inflection point where it can be useful in batch processing in a financial
    business setting.},

    from event-related potentials in a case of selective metamorphopsia},
  abstract = {Visual awareness is thought to result from integration of low-
    and high-level processing; instances of integration failure provide a
    crucial window into the cognitive and neural bases of awareness. We present
    neurophysiological evidence of complex cognitive processing in the absence
    of awareness, raising questions about the conditions necessary for visual
    awareness. We describe an individual with a neurodegenerative disease who
    exhibits impaired visual awareness for the digits 2 to 9, and stimuli
    presented in close proximity to these digits, due to perceptual distortion.
    We identified robust event-related potential responses indicating 1) face
    detection with the N170 component and 2) task-dependent target-word
    detection with the P3b component, despite no awareness of the presence of
    faces or target words. These data force us to reconsider the relationship
    between neural processing and visual awareness; even stimuli processed by a
    workspace-like cognitive system can remain inaccessible to awareness. We
    discuss how this finding challenges and constrains theories of visual
    awareness.},

  abstract = {In this research, we show that 5G millimeter waves could be
    absorbed by dermatologic cells acting like antennas, transferred to other
    cells and play the main role in producing Coronaviruses in biological
    cells. DNA is built from charged electrons and atoms and has an
    inductor-like structure. This structure could be divided into linear,
    toroid and round inductors. Inductors interact with external
    electromagnetic waves, move and produce some extra waves within the cells.
    The shapes of these waves are similar to shapes of hexagonal and pentagonal
    bases of their DNA source. These waves produce some holes in liquids within
    the nucleus. To fill these holes, some extra hexagonal and pentagonal bases
    are produced. These bases could join to each other and form virus-like
    structures such as Coronavirus. To produce these viruses within a cell, it
    is necessary that the wavelength of external waves be shorter than the size
    of the cell. Thus 5G millimeter waves could be good candidates for applying
    in constructing virus-like structures such as Coronaviruses (COVID-19)
    within cells.},

    cyber-attacks executed by compromised IoT devices connected to their
    customers' networks. Such attacks might have severe effects on the attack
    target, as well as the telcos themselves. To mitigate those risks, we
    propose a machine learning-based method that can detect specific vulnerable
    IoT device models connected behind a domestic NAT, thereby identifying home
    networks that pose a risk to the telcos infrastructure and service
    availability. To evaluate our method, we collected a large quantity of
    network traffic data from various commercial IoT devices in our lab and
    compared several classification algorithms. We found that (a) the LGBM
    algorithm produces excellent detection results, and (b) our flow-based
    method is robust and can handle situations for which existing methods used
    to identify devices behind a NAT are unable to fully address, e.g.,
    encrypted, non-TCP or non-DNS traffic. To promote future research in this
    domain we share our novel labeled benchmark dataset.},

    I aim to improve our understanding of elderly people's responses to the

    troubling. Elderly people's response is substantially similar to their
    fellow citizens in their 50's and 60's. This research (i) provides the
    first thorough description of the most vulnerable population's attitudes
    and compliance in a comparative perspective (ii) suggest that governments'
    strategies toward elderly people are far from successful and (iii) shows
    that methodologically, we should be more cautious in treating age as having
    a linear effect on COVID-19 related outcomes.},

    feature which provides a visual cue that the camera is turned on. We
    describe how to disable the LED on a class of Apple internal iSight webcams
    used in some versions of MacBook laptops and iMac desktops. This enables
    video to be captured without any visual indication to the user and can be
    accomplished entirely in user space by an unprivileged (non- root)
    application. The same technique that allows us to disable the LED, namely
    reprogramming the firmware that runs on the iSight, enables a virtual
    machine escape whereby malware running inside a virtual machine reprograms
    the camera to act as a USB Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard which
    executes code in the host operating system. We build two proofs-of-concept:
    (1) an OS X application, iSeeYou, which demonstrates capturing video with
    the LED disabled; and (2) a virtual machine escape that launches
    Terminal.app and runs shell commands. To defend against these and related
    threats, we build an OS X kernel extension, iSightDefender, which prohibits
    the modification of the iSight's firmware from user space.},

  address = {Virtual Event},
  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested various side-channel attacks for
    eavesdropping sound by analyzing the side effects of sound waves on nearby
    objects (e.g., a bag of chips and window) and devices (e.g., motion
    sensors). These methods pose a great threat to privacy, however they are
    limited in one of the following ways: they (1) cannot be applied in real
    time (e.g., Visual Microphone), (2) are not external, requiring the
    attacker to compromise a device with malware (e.g., Gyrophone), or (3) are
    not passive, requiring the attacker to direct a laser beam at an object
    (e.g., laser microphone).

    In this talk, I introduce ``Lamphone,'' a novel side-channel attack for
    eavesdropping sound; this attack is performed by using a remote
    electro-optical sensor to analyze a hanging light bulb's frequency response
    to sound. I show how fluctuations in the air pressure on the surface of the
    hanging bulb (in response to sound), which cause the bulb to vibrate very
    slightly (a millidegree vibration), can be exploited by eavesdroppers to
    recover speech and singing, passively, externally, and in real time. I
    analyze a hanging bulb's response to sound via an electro-optical sensor
    and learn how to isolate the audio signal from the optical signal. Based on
    our analysis, I develop an algorithm to recover sound from the optical
    measurements obtained from the vibrations of a light bulb and captured by
    the electro-optical sensor. I evaluate Lamphone's performance in a
    realistic setup and show that Lamphone can be used by eavesdroppers to
    recover human speech (which can be accurately identified by the Google
    Cloud Speech API) and singing (which can be accurately identified by Shazam
    and SoundHound) from a bridge located 25 meters away from the target room
    containing the hanging light bulb.

  abstract = {The firm is a fundamental economic unit of contemporary human
    societies. Studies on the general quantitative and statistical character of
    firms have produced mixed results regarding their lifespans and mortality.
    We examine a comprehensive database of more than 25 000 publicly traded
    North American companies, from 1950 to 2009, to derive the statistics of
    firm lifespans. Based on detailed survival analysis, we show that the
    mortality of publicly traded companies manifests an approximately constant
    hazard rate over long periods of observation. This regularity indicates
    that mortality rates are independent of a company's age. We show that the
    typical half-life of a publicly traded company is about a decade,
    regardless of business sector. Our results shed new light on the dynamics
    of births and deaths of publicly traded companies and identify some of the
    necessary ingredients of a general theory of firms.},

    HOTSPOT---a new type of airgap crossing technique. Signals can be sent
    secretly from air-gapped computers to nearby smartphones and then on to the
    Internet---in the form of thermal pings. The thermal signals are generated
    by the CPUs and GPUs and intercepted by a nearby smartphone. We examine
    this covert channel and discuss other work in the field of air-gap covert
    communication channels. We present technical background and describe
    thermal sensing in modern smartphones. We implement a transmitter on the
    computer side and a receiver Android App on the smartphone side, and
    discuss the implementation details. We evaluate the covert channel and
    tested it in a typical work place. Our results show that it possible to
    send covert signals from air-gapped PCs to the attacker on the Internet
    through the thermal pings. We also propose countermeasures for this type of
    covert channel which has thus far been overlooked.},

  abstract = {An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT for short) can be defined as a
    targeted and very sophisticated cyber attack. IT administrators need tools
    that allow early detection of these attacks. Several approaches have been
    proposed to provide solutions to this problem based on the attack life
    cycle. Recently, machine learning techniques have been implemented in these
    approaches to improve the problem of detection. This paper aims to propose
    a new approach to APT detection, using machine learning techniques, and
    based on the life cycle of an APT attack. The proposed model is organised
    in two passive stages and three active stages to adapt the mitigation
    techniques based on machine learning.},

  abstract = {It is known that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped
    computers through their speakers via sonic and ultrasonic waves. To
    eliminate the threat of such acoustic covert channels in sensitive systems,
    audio hardware can be disabled and the use of loudspeakers can be strictly
    forbidden. Such audio-less systems are considered to be
    \textit{audio-gapped}, and hence immune to acoustic covert channels. In
    this paper, we introduce a technique that enable attackers leak data
    acoustically from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems. Our developed
    malware can exploit the computer power supply unit (PSU) to play sounds and
    use it as an out-of-band, secondary speaker with limited capabilities. The
    malicious code manipulates the internal \textit{switching frequency} of the
    power supply and hence controls the sound waveforms generated from its
    capacitors and transformers. Our technique enables producing audio tones in
    a frequency band of 0-24khz and playing audio streams (e.g., WAV) from a
    computer power supply without the need for audio hardware or speakers.
    Binary data (files, keylogging, encryption keys, etc.) can be modulated
    over the acoustic signals and sent to a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone).
    We show that our technique works with various types of systems: PC
    workstations and servers, as well as embedded systems and IoT devices that
    have no audio hardware at all. We provide technical background and discuss
    implementation details such as signal generation and data modulation. We
    show that the POWER-SUPPLaY code can operate from an ordinary user-mode
    process and doesn't need any hardware access or special privileges. Our
    evaluation shows that using POWER-SUPPLaY, sensitive data can be
    exfiltrated from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems from a distance of
    five meters away at a maximal bit rates of 50 bit/sec.},

  author = {Zhan, Zihao and Zhang, Zhenkai and Koutsoukos, Xenofon},
  abstract = {An air-gapped computer is physically isolated from unsecured
    networks to guarantee effective protection against data exfiltration. Due
    to air gaps, unauthorized data transfer seems impossible over legitimate
    communication channels, but in reality many so-called physical covert
    channels can be constructed to allow data exfiltration across the air gaps.
    Most of such covert channels are very slow and often require certain strict
    conditions to work (e.g., no physical obstacles between the sender and the
    receiver). In this paper, we introduce a new physical covert channel named
    BitJabber that is extremely fast and strong enough to even penetrate
    concrete walls. We show that this covert channel can be easily created by
    an unprivileged sender running on a victim's computer. Specifically, the
    sender constructs the channel by using only memory accesses to modulate the
    electromagnetic (EM) signals generated by the DRAM clock. While possessing
    a very high bandwidth (up to 300,000 bps), this new covert channel is also
    very reliable (less than 1\% error rate). More importantly, this covert
    channel can enable data exfiltration from an air-gapped computer enclosed
    in a room with thick concrete walls up to 15 cm.},

    Computers via Covert Hard Drive Noise},
  year = 2016,
  month = {August},
  abstract = {Air-gapped computers are disconnected from the Internet
    physically and logically. This measure is taken in order to prevent the
    leakage of sensitive data from secured networks. In the past, it has been
    shown that malware can exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers by
    transmitting ultrasonic signals via the computer's speakers. However, such
    acoustic communication relies on the availability of speakers on a
    computer. In this paper, we present `DiskFiltration,' a covert channel
    which facilitates the leakage of data from an air-gapped compute via
    acoustic signals emitted from its hard disk drive (HDD). Our method is
    unique in that, unlike other acoustic covert channels, it doesn't require
    the presence of speakers or audio hardware in the air-gapped computer. A
    malware installed on a compromised machine can generate acoustic emissions
    at specific audio frequencies by controlling the movements of the HDD's
    actuator arm. Digital Information can be modulated over the acoustic
    signals and then be picked up by a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone,
    smartwatch, laptop, etc.). We examine the HDD anatomy and analyze its
    acoustical characteristics. We also present signal generation and
    detection, and data modulation and demodulation algorithms. Based on our
    proposed method, we developed a transmitter on a personal computer and a
    receiver on a smartphone, and we provide the design and implementation
    details. We also evaluate our covert channel on various types of internal
    and external HDDs in different computer chassis and at various distances.
    With DiskFiltration we were able to covertly transmit data (e.g.,
    passwords, encryption keys, and keylogging data) between air-gapped
    computers to a smartphone at an effective bit rate of 180 bits/minute
    (10,800 bits/hour) and a distance of up to two meters (six feet).},

    twisted fibres on stone tools from the Abri du Maras led to the hypothesis
    of Neanderthal string production in the past, but conclusive evidence was

    3-ply cord fragment made from inner bark fibres on a stone tool recovered
    in situ from the same site. Twisted fibres provide the basis for clothing,
    rope, bags, nets, mats, boats, etc. which, once discovered, would have
    become an indispensable part of daily life. Understanding and use of
    twisted fibres implies the use of complex multi-component technology as
    well as a mathematical understanding of pairs, sets, and numbers. Added to
    recent evidence of birch bark tar, art, and shell beads, the idea that
    Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to modern humans is becoming
    increasingly untenable.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that the integrity of sensor
    measurements can be violated through out-of-band signal injection attacks.
    These attacks target the conversion process from a physical quantity to an
    analog property---a process that fundamentally cannot be authenticated.
    Out-of-band signal injection attacks thus pose previously-unexplored
    security risks by exploiting hardware imperfections in the sensors
    themselves, or in their interfaces to microcontrollers. In response to the
    growing-yet-disjointed literature in the subject, this article presents the
    first survey of out-of-band signal injection attacks. It focuses on
    unifying their terminology and identifying commonalities in their causes
    and effects through a chronological, evolutionary, and thematic taxonomy of
    attacks. By highlighting cross-influences between different types of
    out-of-band signal injections, this paper underscores the need for a common
    language irrespective of the attack method. By placing attack and defense
    mechanisms in the wider context of their dual counterparts of side-channel
    leakage and electromagnetic interference, this study identifies common
    threads and gaps that can help guide and inform future research. Overall,
    the ever-increasing reliance on sensors embedded in everyday commodity
    devices necessitates that a stronger focus be placed on improving the
    security of such systems against out-of-band signal injection attacks.},

    thirdhand smoke (THS) is an important, poorly understood public health
    concern. Real-time THS off-gassing from smokers into a nonsmoking movie
    theater was observed with online and offline high-resolution mass
    spectrometry. Prominent emission events of THS tracers (e.g.,
    2,5-dimethylfuran, 2-methylfuran, and acetonitrile) and other
    tobacco-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs) coincided with the
    arrival of certain moviegoers and left residual contamination. These VOC
    emission events exposed occupants to the equivalent of 1 to 10 cigarettes
    of secondhand smoke, including multiple hazardous air pollutants (e.g.,
    benzene and formaldehyde) at parts-per-billion concentrations. Nicotine and
    related intermediate-volatility nitrogen-containing compounds, which
    vaporized from clothes/bodies and recondensed onto aerosol, comprised 34\%
    of observed functionalized organic aerosol abundance. Exposure to THS VOC
    emission events will be considerably enhanced in poorly ventilated or
    smaller spaces in contrast with a large, well-ventilated
    theater---amplifying concentrations and potential impacts on health and indoor chemistry.},

  abstract = {Quantum scrambling is the dispersal of local information into
    many-body quantum entanglements and correlations distributed throughout an
    entire system. This concept accompanies the dynamics of thermalization in
    closed quantum systems, and has recently emerged as a powerful tool for
    characterizing chaos in black holes. However, the direct experimental
    measurement of quantum scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential
    complexity of ergodic many-body entangled states. One way to characterize
    quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation
    function (OTOC); however, because scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do
    not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary
    decoherence. Here we implement a quantum circuit that provides a positive
    test for the scrambling features of a given unitary process. This
    approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through the circuit,
    providing an unambiguous test for whether scrambling has occurred, while
    simultaneously measuring an OTOC. We engineer quantum scrambling processes
    through a tunable three-qubit unitary operation as part of a seven-qubit
    circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured teleportation fidelities
    are typically about 80 per cent, and enable us to experimentally bound the
    scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC measurement.},

  abstract = {Many college students intend to pursue science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) careers but quickly abandon these goals when
    confronted with notoriously competitive STEM courses that often pit
    students against each other. This emphasis on interpersonal competition
    could be especially detrimental for first-generation (FG) college students,
    an underrepresented group in STEM fields which more strongly values
    communality and collaboration relative to their continuing-generation
    peers. Thus, FG students may experience more imposter feelings in STEM
    courses perceived as having a competitive culture. A longitudinal study
    (with 818 students and 2,638 experience-sampling observations) found that
    perceived classroom competition was associated with greater daily in-class
    imposter feelings among all students---but especially among FG students.
    Imposter feelings in turn predicted students' end-of-term course
    engagement, attendance, dropout intentions, and course grades. Classroom
    competition and the imposter feelings it engenders may be an overlooked
    barrier for promoting the engagement, performance, and retention of FG
    students in STEM.},

    at the agency, enhancing the integration of knowledge into practice,
    intensifying opportunities for the sharing of knowledge by providing
    opportunities for students to work with faculty and staff on individual
    projects, and enriching the application of knowledge by providing
    opportunities for faculty clinical practice and consultation. The Scholar
    in Residence is a model of collaboration between the university and the
    community that reflects the mission of the university and provides value to
    the community agency through strategic engagement of both entities.},

    the public via the internet. In this poster, I present and discuss numerous
    examples of insect/arthropod-like forms (fossil \& living) found in Mars
    rover photos. Examples include insect-like forms displaying apparent
    diversity, clearly recognizable insect/arthropod anatomical features, and
    flight. Evidence of a fossil reptile-like (serpentine) form and
    reptile-like forms preying on insect-like forms is also presented. Each
    example is documented. These findings provide a compelling basis for

  abstract = {We show \ce{H2O2} is spontaneously produced from pure water by
    atomizing bulk water into microdroplets (1 \textmu m to 20 \textmu m in
    diameter). Production of \ce{H2O2}, as assayed by \ce{H2O2}-sensitve
    fluorescence dye peroxyfluor-1, increased with decreasing microdroplet
    size. Cleavage of 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid and conversion of
    phenylboronic acid to phenols in microdroplets further confirmed the
    generation of \ce{H2O2}. The generated \ce{H2O2} concentration was
    $\sim 30$ \textmu M ($\sim 1$ part per million) as determined by titration
    with potassium titanium oxalate. Changing the spray gas to \ce{O2} or
    bubbling \ce{O2} decreased the yield of \ce{H2O2} in microdroplets,
    indicating that pure water microdroplets directly generate \ce{H2O2}
    without help from \ce{O2} either in air surrounding the droplet or
    dissolved in water. We consider various possible mechanisms for \ce{H2O2}
    formation and report a number of different experiments exploring this
    issue. We suggest that hydroxyl radical (\ce{OH}) recombination is the most
    likely source, in which \ce{OH} is generated by loss of an electron from
    \ce{OH-} at or near the surface of the water microdroplet. This
    catalyst-free and voltage-free \ce{H2O2} production method provides
    innovative opportunities for green production of hydrogen peroxide.},

    accumulating plastic},
  abstract = {Ocean plastic can persist in sea surface waters, eventually
  accumulating in remote areas of the world's oceans. Here we characterise and
  quantify a major ocean plastic accumulation zone formed in subtropical waters
  between California and Hawaii: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). Our
  model, calibrated with data from multi-vessel and aircraft surveys, predicted
  at least 79 (45--129) thousand tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an
  area of 1.6 million km\textsuperscript{2}; a figure four to sixteen times
  higher than previously reported. We explain this difference through the use
  of more robust methods to quantify larger debris. Over three-quarters of the
  GPGP mass was carried by debris larger than 5 cm and at least 46\% was
  comprised of fishing nets. Microplastics accounted for 8\% of the total mass
  but 94\% of the estimated 1.8 (1.1--3.6) trillion pieces floating in the
  area. Plastic collected during our study has specific characteristics such as
  small surface-to-volume ratio, indicating that only certain types of debris
  have the capacity to persist and accumulate at the surface of the GPGP.
  Finally, our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is
  increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.},

  abstract = {In face perception, besides physiognomic changes, accessories
    like eyeglasses can influence facial appearance. According to a stereotype,
    people who wear glasses are more intelligent, but less attractive. In a
    series of four experiments, we showed how full-rim and rimless glasses,
    differing with respect to the amount of face they cover, affect face
    perception, recognition, distinctiveness, and the attribution of
    stereotypes. Eyeglasses generally directed observers' gaze to the eye
    regions; rimless glasses made faces appear less distinctive and resulted in
    reduced distinctiveness in matching and in recognition tasks. Moreover, the
    stereotype was confirmed but depended on the kind of glasses---rimless
    glasses yielded an increase in perceived trustworthiness, but not a
    decrease in attractiveness. Thus, glasses affect how we perceive the faces
    of the people wearing them and, in accordance with an old stereotype, they
    can lower how attractive, but increase how intelligent and trustworthy
    people wearing them appear. These effects depend on the kind of glasses
    worn.},

    objects were in accordance with the reversed visual field. The extent of
    movement was however inappropriate, and a confusion persisted in the
    localization of the body parts. On replacing the lenses with an empty black
    lined paper tube at the end of the experiment. The visual image relapsed to
    its original form but images from the experimental situation kept
    interfering. Concluded that the visual system is a relatively stable
    structure, however adjustment is required. The inverted position of the
    retinal image is not essential to upright vision as it does not contribute
    towards harmony between touch and sight. Direction of movement is not
    judged on purely muscular evidence but on subjective experience and

    from the first STARMU flight on a commercial GEO spacecraft in early 2019.
    As the hardware supplier, Honeywell has integrated two flight proven,
    autonomous Active Pixel Sensor (APS)-based star trackers from Sodern with a
    redundant electronics unit that includes a processor, two sets of
    three-axis accelerometers and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
    gyros. We describe the STARMU design and qualification for GPS IIIF mission
    requirements, including natural and nuclear threat radiation environments,
    and provide expected sensor performance to demonstrate enhanced GPS IIIF
    space vehicle attitude determination and control accuracy with the STARMU
    compared to the current GPS III earth and sun sensor-based ACS. Using
    continuous three-axis star tracker data as the primary attitude and
    attitude rate measurements, the system improves antenna pointing accuracy
    by $8\%$ in the nadir direction and $>50\%$ in rotation about nadir, with
    corresponding improvements to navigation and hosted payload performance. A
    backup attitude determination system that utilizes the STARMU MEMS gyros
    and a coarse sun sensor during early orbit and safe mode operations is also
    described.},

    $n$-bit {RSA} with $n/2$ Qubits},
  author = {Alexander May and Lars Schlieper},
  year = 2019,
  month = {24 May},
  abstract = {We study quantum period finding algorithms such as Simon, Shor,
    and Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad. For a periodic function $f$ these algorithms
    produce---via some quantum embedding of $f$---a quantum superposition
    $\sum_x\Ket{x}\Ket{f(x)}$,
    which requires a certain amount of output bits that represent
    $\Ket{f(x)}$. We show that we can lower this amount to a single output
    qubit by hashing $f$ down to a single bit. Namely, we replace the embedding
    of $f$ in quantum period finding circuits by several embeddings of hashed
    versions of $f$. We show that on expectation this modification only doubles
    the required amount of quantum measurements, while significantly reducing
    the total number of qubits. For example, for Simon's period finding
    algorithm in some $n$-bit function
    $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_2^n$ our hashing technique reduces
    the required qubits from $2n$ down to $n+1$. For the Eker\aa-H\aa stad
    algorithm for factoring $n$-bit RSA our hashing reduces the required qubits
    from $({3\over 2}+o(1))n$ down to $({1\over 2}+o(1))n$.},

    and UK Biobank (total $N = 300,486$; age 16--102) and find 148 genome-wide
    significant independent loci ($P < 5 \times 10^{-8}$) associated with
    general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants
    associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders,
    physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based
    analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function.
    Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive
    function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3\% of variance in general
    cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect
    significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction
    time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and
    longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways
    contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Many workloads are written in garbage-collected languages and GC
    consumes a significant fraction of resources for these workloads. We
    propose to decrease this overhead by moving GC into a small hardware
    accelerator that is located close to the memory controller and performs GC
    more efficiently than a CPU. We first show a general design of such a GC
    accelerator and describe how it can be integrated into both stop-the-world
    and pause-free garbage collectors. We then demonstrate an end-to-end RTL
    prototype, integrated into a RocketChip RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)
    executing full Java benchmarks within JikesRVM running under Linux on
    FPGAs. Our prototype performs the mark phase of a tracing GC at $4.2\times$
    the performance of an in-order CPU, at just 18.5\% the area. By prototyping
    our design in a real system, we show that our accelerator can be adopted
    without invasive changes to the SoC, and estimate its performance, area,
    and energy.},

  these cases, do firms promote the best potential manager or the best worker
  in her current job? Using microdata on the performance of sales workers at
  214 firms, we find evidence consistent with the ``Peter Principle,'' which
  predicts that firms prioritize current job performance in promotion decisions
  at the expense of other observable characteristics that better predict
  managerial performance.  We estimate that the costs of promoting workers with
  lower managerial potential are high, suggesting either that firms are making
  inefficient promotion decisions or that  the benefits of promotion-based
  incentives are great enough to justify the costs of managerial mismatch.},

  abstract = {Photonic cooling of matter has enabled both access to unexplored
    states of matter, such as Bose--Einstein condensates, and novel approaches
    to solid-state refrigeration. Critical to these photonic cooling approaches
    is the use of low-entropy coherent radiation from lasers, which makes the
    cooling process thermodynamically feasible. Recent theoretical work has
    suggested that photonic solid-state cooling may be accomplished by tuning
    the chemical potential of photons without using coherent laser radiation,
    but such cooling has not been experimentally realized. Here we report an
    experimental demonstration of photonic cooling without laser light using a
    custom-fabricated nanocalorimetric device and a photodiode. We show that
    when they are in each other's near-field---that is, when the size of the
    vacuum gap between the planar surfaces of the calorimetric device and a
    reverse-biased photodiode is reduced to tens of nanometres---solid-state
    cooling of the calorimetric device can be accomplished via a combination of
    photon tunnelling, which enhances the transport of photons across nanoscale
    gaps, and suppression of photon emission from the photodiode due to a
    change in the chemical potential of the photons under an applied reverse
    bias. This demonstration of active nanophotonic cooling---without the use
    of coherent laser radiation---lays the experimental foundation for
    systematic exploration of nanoscale photonics and optoelectronics for
    solid-state refrigeration and on-chip device cooling.},

  abstract = {As a copious source of gamma-rays, a nearby Galactic Gamma-Ray
    Burst (GRB) can be a threat to life. Using recent determinations of the
    rate of GRBs, their luminosity function and properties of their host
    galaxies, we estimate the probability that a life-threatening (lethal)
    GRB would take place. Amongst the different kinds of GRBs, long ones are
    most dangerous. There is a very good chance (but no certainty) that at
    least one lethal GRB took place during the past 5 Gyr close enough to
    Earth as to significantly damage life. There is a 50\% chance that such a
    lethal GRB took place during the last 500 Myr causing one of the major
    mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of radiation would
    be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore the
    potential effects of GRBs to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the
    Universe. We find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much larger in
    the inner Milky Way (95\% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic
    center), making it inhospitable to life. Only at the outskirts of the
    Milky Way, at more than 10 kpc from the galactic center, this probability
    drops below 50\%. When considering the Universe as a whole, the safest
    environments for life (similar to the one on Earth) are the lowest
    density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies and life can exist in
    only $\approx 10\%$ of galaxies. Remarkably, a cosmological constant is
    essential for such systems to exist. Furthermore, because of both the
    higher GRB rate and galaxies being smaller, life as it exists on Earth
    could not take place at $z > 0.5$. Early life forms must have been much
    more resilient to radiation.},

    crime using Facebook data. We study the case of Germany, where the
    recently emerged right-wing party {\it Alternative f\"{u}r Deutschland}
    (AfD) has developed a major social media presence. We show that
    right-wing anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook predicts violent crimes
    against refugees in otherwise similar municipalities with higher social
    media usage. To further establish causality, we exploit exogenous
    variation in major internet and Facebook outages, which fully undo the
    correlation between social media and hate crime. We further find that the
    effect decreases with distracting news events; increases with user
    network interactions; and does not hold for posts unrelated to refugees.
    Our results suggest that social media can act as a propagation mechanism
    between online hate speech and real-life violent crime.},

  abstract = {The recently discovered S1 stream passes through the Solar
    neighborhood on a low inclination, counterrotating orbit. The progenitor
    of S1 is a dwarf galaxy with a total mass comparable to the present-day
    Fornax dwarf spheroidal, so the stream is expected to have a significant
    DM component. We compute the effects of the S1 stream on WIMP and axion
    detectors as a function of the density of its unmeasured dark component.
    In WIMP detectors the S1 stream supplies more high energy nuclear recoils
    so will marginally improve DM detection prospects. We find that even if
    S1 comprises less than 10\% of the local density, multiton xenon WIMP
    detectors can distinguish the S1 stream from the bulk halo in the
    relatively narrow mass range between 5 and 25 GeV. In directional WIMP
    detectors such as CYGNUS, S1 increases DM detection prospects more
    substantially since it enhances the anisotropy of the WIMP signal.
    Finally, we show that axion haloscopes possess by far the greatest
    potential sensitivity to the S1 stream if its dark matter component is
    sufficiently cold. Once the axion mass has been discovered, the
    distinctive velocity distribution of S1 can easily be extracted from the
    axion power spectrum.},

    We examined how people justified their agreement with statements

    reflecting the scientific consensus on these topics, then responded to
    open-ended questions asking them to justify their position and to
    generate challenges to their belief. Responses to individual difference
    measures allowed us to assess the relationship between participants'
    positions on these scientific issues and cognitive style, conspiracy
    ideation, religious service attendance, and political ideology.
    Qualitative analyses revealed inconsistent and topic-specific patterns of
    reasoning. Additionally, greater agreement with scientific conclusions
    was related to a greater predisposition towards analytical thinking and
    stronger self-reported political liberalism. These findings provide a
    next step for better understanding why some individuals reject science

    acceptance.},

    identified as one of the top barriers for realizing the vision of smart,
    energy-efficient homes and buildings. In this context, understanding the
    risks related to the use and potential misuse of information about homes,
    partners, and end-users, as well as, forming methods for integrating
    security-enhancing measures in the design is not straightforward and thus
    requires substantial investigation. A risk analysis applied on a smart
    home automation system developed in a research project involving leading
    industrial actors has been conducted. Out of 32 examined risks, 9 were
    classified as low and 4 as high, i.e., most of the identified risks were
    deemed as moderate. The risks classified as high were either related to
    the human factor or to the software components of the system. The results
    indicate that with the implementation of standard security features, new,
    as well as, current risks can be minimized to acceptable levels albeit
    that the most serious risks, i.e., those derived from the human factor,
    need more careful consideration, as they are inherently complex to
    handle. A discussion of the implications of the risk analysis results
    points to the need for a more general model of security and privacy
    included in the design phase of smart homes. With such a model of
    security and privacy in design in place, it will contribute to enforcing
    system security and enhancing user privacy in smart homes, and thus
    helping to further realize the potential in such IoT environments.},

    for embedding a secret message. In this paper, we propose a construction
    based data hiding technique which transforms a secret message into a
    fingerprint image directly. Unlike the conventional data hiding
    techniques, this scheme does not need any cover signals to participate.
    Instead, it generates the fingerprint image based on a piece of hologram
    phase constructed from the secret message. The hologram phase consists of
    the spiral phase and the continuous phase. Firstly, we propose to map the
    secret message to a polynomial and encode it into a set of points with
    different polarities, from which the spiral phase is computed and
    constructed. Then, we construct the continuous phase by decomposing a
    fingerprint image synthetically generated. The spiral phase and the
    continuous phase are combined to form the hologram phase. This is
    eventually used to construct a fingerprint image in a common form such as
    a grayscale fingerprint image, a binary fingerprint image, or a thinned
    fingerprint image. The secret message can be extracted by detecting the
    encoded points in the constructed fingerprint. We conduct the experiments
    by constructing fingerprint images with ordinary sizes, the results show
    that the secret message can be extracted accurately. It is also difficult
    to detect the existence of secret message from the constructed
    fingerprint images.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the ability to produce a laser beam
    detectable to a cursory survey (SNR 0.1\% with a 1 m receive telescope)
    by an extraterrestrial intelligence using proven or near-term technology
    (megawatt-class lasers, telescopes tens of meters in size). We find that
    such lasers can produce a signal at ranges of less than 20,000 lt-yr,
    with a broad enough beam to overcome uncertainties in nearby exoplanet
    orbits (e.g., Prox Cen b) or encompass entire habitable zones of more
    distant systems (e.g., TRAPPIST-1). While the probability of closing a
    handshake with even a nearby extraterrestrial intelligence is low with
    current survey methodologies, advances in full-sky surveys for SETI and
    other purposes may reduce the mean-time-to-handshake to decades or
    centuries, after which these laser systems may close links at data rates
    of kbps--Mpbs. The next major gap to address for searching for
    extraterrestrial lasers is in expanding spectral searches into the
    infrared, where most terrestrial communication and high-power lasers are
    manufactured.},

    is examined. Examples are presented of clearly visible emissions from
    typical hydrogen flames. It is shown that while visible emissions from
    these flames are considerably weaker than those from comparable
    hydrocarbon flames, they are indeed visible, albeit at reduced light
    levels in most cases. Detailed flame spectra are presented to
    characterize flame emission bands in the ultraviolet, visible and
    infrared regions of the spectrum that result in a visible hydrogen flame.
    The visible blue emission is emphasized, and recorded spectra indicate
    that fine spectral structure is superimposed on a broadband continuum
    extending from the ultraviolet into the visible region. Tests were
    performed to show that this emission does not arise from carbon or
    nitrogen chemistry resulting from carbon-containing impurities
    (hydrocarbons) in the hydrogen fuel or from \ce{CO2} or \ce{N2}
    entrainment from the surrounding air. The spectral structure, however, is
    also observed in methane flames. The magnitude of the broadband emission
    increases with flame temperature in a highly nonlinear manner while the
    finer spectral structure is insensitive to temperature. A comparison of
    diffusion and premixed \ce{H2} flames shows that the fine scale structure
    is comparable in both flames.},

  abstract = {We prove Zimmer's conjecture for $C^2$ actions by finite-index
    subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{Z})$ provided $m>3$. The method
    utilizes many ingredients from our earlier proof of the conjecture for
    actions by cocompact lattices in $\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{R})$ but new
    ideas are needed to overcome the lack of compactness of the space
    $(G\times M)/\Gamma$ (admitting the induced $G$-action). Non-compactness
    allows both measures and Lyapunov exponents to escape to infinity under
    averaging and a number of algebraic, geometric, and dynamical tools are
    used control this escape. New ideas are provided by the work of Lubotzky,
    Mozes, and Raghunathan on the structure of nonuniform lattices and, in
    particular, of $\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{Z})$ providing a geometric
    decomposition of the cusp into rank one directions, whose geometry is
    more easily controlled. The proof also makes use of a precise
    quantitative form of non-divergence of unipotent orbits by Kleinbock and
    Margulis, and an extension by de la Salle of strong property (T) to
    representations of nonuniform lattices.}

    allows non-linear parallel computation upon simultaneous sensory inputs.
    Temporal patterns of stimulation are converted to spatial patterns of
    water waves upon which a linear discrimination can be made. Whereas

    neural network parameters, water has inherent self-organising properties
    such as strong local interactions, time-dependent spread of activation to
    distant areas, inherent stability to a wide variety of inputs, and high
    complexity. Water achieves this ``for free'', and does so without the
    time-consuming computation required by realistic neural models. An

    article theorises that forced connections happen when algorithms
    exacerbate human actions in connecting otherwise disparate data points on
    digitally networked platforms to the subject of the data's detriment.
    Although social media users may not have a comprehensive understanding of
    how algorithms work to make some content visible, when users form their
    own explanatory theories about these algorithms, they often intervene in
    these connections. Drawing on Michel de Certeau's notion of strategies as
    the manipulations in which platforms engage to profile and control their
    users, and tactics as everyday acts of resistance, this article
    investigates two tactics within algorithmic cultures---Voldemorting, or
    not mentioning words or names in order to avoid a forced connection; and
    screenshotting, or making content visible without sending its website
    traffic---to demonstrate users' understandings of the algorithms that
    seek to connect individuals to other people, platforms, content and
    advertisers, and their efforts to wrest back control.},

  abstract = {An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is a medical
    device used for the detection of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia and
    their treatment through the delivery of electrical shocks intended to
    restore normal heart rhythm. An ICD reprogramming attack seeks to alter
    the device's parameters to induce unnecessary shocks and, even more
    egregious, prevent required therapy. In this paper, we present a formal
    approach for the synthesis of ICD reprogramming attacks that are both
    effective, i.e., lead to fundamental changes in the required therapy, and
    stealthy, i.e., involve minimal changes to the nominal ICD parameters. We
    focus on the discrimination algorithm underlying Boston Scientific
    devices (one of the principal ICD manufacturers) and formulate the
    synthesis problem as one of multi-objective optimization. Our solution
    technique is based on an Optimization Modulo Theories encoding of the
    problem and allows us to derive device parameters that are optimal with
    respect to the effectiveness-stealthiness tradeoff (i.e., lie along the
    corresponding Pareto front). To the best of our knowledge, our work is
    the first to derive systematic ICD reprogramming attacks designed to
    maximize therapy disruption while minimizing detection. To evaluate our
    technique, we employ an extensive dataset of synthetic EGMs (cardiac
    signals), each generated with a prescribed arrhythmia, allowing us to
    synthesize attacks tailored to the victim's cardiac condition. Our
    approach readily generalizes to unseen signals, representing the unknown
    EGM of the victim patient.},

    loss of life or damage to the structure can occur. The geometry and use
    of the compartment as well as the fuel packages within must be taken into
    account when choosing an appropriate fire suppression system. This thesis
    explores novel suppression methods inside of compartments. Los Alamos
    National Laboratories came to the University of Texas Fire Research Group
    (UTFRG) to characterize and investigate the fire danger inside of nuclear
    gloveboxes. The first suppression method discussed explores activation
    tests of a commercial automatic fire suppression system (Fire Foe
    [superscript TM]) containing heptaflouropropane (FE-36) fire suppressant
    conducted within a glovebox at the UTFRG's burn structure. Temperature
    and time to activation data of ten tests at four different fire sizes,
    three 13 kW, one 20 kW, three 25 kW, and three 50 kW, was taken. Gas
    temperatures from experiments were compared against NIST's Fire Dynamics
    Simulator (FDS) gas temperatures with good agreement. The time and
    spatially averaged net heat flux on a virtual Fire Foe [superscript TM]
    tube from the FDS simulations were passed to a thermo-physical,
    semi-empirical, sub-model to predict activation with poor agreement from
    experimental activation times. A Bayesian parameter inference was later
    run on the sub-model. While the Bayesian inference approach is able to
    match sub-model temperatures to experimental temperatures, some
    non-physical values for heat transfer coefficients and view factors were
    observed at the lower heat release rate fires. Micro combustion
    calorimetry (MCC) was used to determine heat of combustion of glovebox
    glove material and cone calorimetry tests were run to find ignition time
    versus incident heat flux. Using standard ignition time models, effective
    model parameters were calibrated. Thermal characterization of the glove
    material showed that the heat of combustion found from MCC was within the
    range of heats of combustion for other non-halogenated materials found in
    the literature. Analysis of the time to ignition tests showed that the
    glove material should be modeled as thermally thick when one would expect
    thin behavior. This behavior was attributed to possible heat losses from
    the back of the glove material. Dry water is expected to have similar
    suppression characteristics as water mist systems because the dry water
    particle sizes are on the order of water mist droplet sizes. The major
    benefit with dry water is the low pressures needed to drive the aerosol.
    An issue encountered with the dry water was flowing it in the way one
    would flow normal water. It was found that at low normal and shear
    stresses, the dry water clathrates would release the water held inside. A
    possible low shear delivery mechanism was discussed that avoids the
    ratholing effect. A continuous dry water production system was also
    designed. Filter loading tests were conducted to determine the quality of
    the dry water collected from the batch and continuous cases. It was
    observed that the ratio of water to silica for the continuous case
    reaches the batch value and is similar to results found in the
    literature. For the batch dry water it was observed that the particle
    size of the dried clathrates does vary with rotational speed of the
    blender and is independent of the type of water used (tap or
    deionized).},

  abstract = {It is well known that a jostled string tends to become knotted;
    yet the factors governing the ``spontaneous'' formation of various knots
    are unclear. We performed experiments in which a string was tumbled
    inside a box and found that complex knots often form within seconds. We
    used mathematical knot theory to analyze the knots. Above a critical
    string length, the probability $P$ of knotting at first increased sharply
    with length but then saturated below 100\%. This behavior differs from
    that of mathematical self-avoiding random walks, where $P$ has been proven
    to approach 100\%. Finite agitation time and jamming of the string due to
    its stiffness result in lower probability, but $P$ approaches 100\% with
    long, flexible strings. We analyzed the knots by calculating their Jones
    polynomials via computer analysis of digital photos of the string.
    Remarkably, almost all were identified as prime knots: 120 different
    types, having minimum crossing numbers up to 11, were observed in 3,415
    trials. All prime knots with up to seven crossings were observed. The
    relative probability of forming a knot decreased exponentially with
    minimum crossing number and M\"{o}bius energy, mathematical measures of
    knot complexity. Based on the observation that long, stiff strings tend to
    form a coiled structure when confined, we propose a simple model to
    describe the knot formation based on random ``braid moves'' of the string
    end. Our model can qualitatively account for the observed distribution of
    knots and dependence on agitation time and string length.},

    The Internet has increased economic and social complexity while reducing

    understand, design and intervene in systems.

    I draw on my experience working in organizations and communities to

    magnetic stimulation of V5 at intervals of -20 to +10 ms before or after
    the onset of visual stimulation was effective in abolishing motion
    perception---other delays were not; (ii) magnetic stimulation of V1
    abolished motion perception only marginally and at delays which were
    significantly different from those obtained with V5, the stimulation now
    being effective only at delays of 60--70 ms after the onset of visual
    stimulation. We conclude (i) that stimulation of V5 is a much more potent
    way of inducing akinetopsia (motion imperception) than stimulation of V1;
    (ii) that perceptually effective visual motion signals reach V5 at or
    before 30 ms and reach V1 at or before 60 ms---consequently, perceptually
    effective motion signals reach V5 before they reach V1; (iii) that, given
    the time course of arrival of signals in V1 and V5, it takes about 30--50
    ms for signals from V1 to reach V5. We conclude further that there are
    probably two components reaching V5 from the retina, a fast one which
    bypasses V1 and a slow one which reaches it through V1.},

    promising framework for identifying the meaningful components of the
    information contained in a joint distribution. Its adoption and practical
    application, however, have been stymied by the lack of a
    generally-accepted method of quantifying its components. Here, we briefly
    discuss the bivariate (two-source) partial information decomposition and
    two implicitly directional interpretations used to intuitively motivate
    alternative component definitions. Drawing parallels with secret key
    agreement rates from information-theoretic cryptography, we demonstrate
    that these intuitions are mutually incompatible and suggest that this
    underlies the persistence of competing definitions and interpretations.
    Having highlighted this hitherto unacknowledged issue, we outline several
    possible solutions.},

    experiments, unexpected results, and new collaborations frequently change
    the course of research. This paper describes the course of my thesis, and
    how its initial topic of distributed databases changed to covert
    channels, then anonymity, before eventually settling on links between the
    two. This illustrates concrete benefits from informal interactions,
    low-overhead collaboration, and flexibility of research project plans.},

  abstract = {Statistical agencies face a dual mandate to publish accurate
    statistics while protecting respondent privacy. Increasing privacy
    protection requires decreased accuracy. Recognizing this as a resource
    allocation problem, we propose an economic solution: operate where the
    marginal cost of increasing privacy equals the marginal benefit. Our
    model of production, from computer science, assumes data are published
    using an efficient differentially private algorithm. Optimal choice
    weighs the demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy.
    Examples from U.S.\ statistical programs show how our framework can guide
    decision-making. Further progress requires a better understanding of
    willingness-to-pay for privacy and statistical accuracy.}

        the meaning is opaque to humans. Several instances of nonsensical

        voice-controlled digital assistant, but which were incomprehensible
        to humans, as shown in tests with human experimental subjects. Our

        voice-controlled digital assistants or other speech-controlled
        devices in speech sounds which are perceived by humans as

        a statical associative version, with each version corresponding to a
        competing view of the proper goal of privacy or nondiscrimination.
        Second, for each version, we show that a difference between the
        privacy edition of the version and the nondiscrimination edition of
        the version is related to the difference between Bayesian
        probabilities and frequentist probabilities. In particular, privacy
        admits both Bayesian and frequentist interpretations whereas
        nondiscrimination is limited to the frequentist interpretation. We

        communication based train control (CBTC) systems and develop the
        countermeasures to limit the attacks' impact. CBTC supports the train
        operation automation and moving-block signaling, which improves the
        transport efficiency. We consider an attacker jamming the wireless
        communication between the trains or the train to wayside access
        point, which can disable CBTC and the corresponding benefits. In
        contrast to prior work studying jamming only at the physical or link
        layer, we study the real impact of such attacks on end users, namely
        train journey time and passenger congestion. Our analysis employs a
        detailed model of leaky medium-based communication system (leaky
        waveguide or leaky feeder/coaxial cable) popularly used in CBTC
        systems. To counteract the jamming attacks, we develop a mitigation
        approach based on frequency hopping spread spectrum taking into
        account domain-specific structure of the leaky-medium CBTC systems.
        Specifically, compared with existing implementations of FHSS, we
        apply FHSS not only between the transmitter-receiver pair but also at
        the track-side repeaters. To demonstrate the feasibility of
        implementing this technology in CBTC systems, we develop a FHSS
        repeater prototype using software-defined radios on both leaky-medium
        and open-air (free-wave) channels. We perform extensive simulations
        driven by realistic running profiles of trains and real-world
        passenger data to provide insights into the jamming attack's impact
        and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.},

        should not depend on programmers to provide security for end-users as
        majority of programmers are not experts of computer security. On the
        other hand, some studies have revealed that security experts believe
        programmers have a major role to play in ensuring the end-users'
        security. However, there has been no investigation on what
        programmers perceive about their responsibility for the end-users'
        security of applications they develop. In this work, by conducting a
        qualitative experimental study with 40 software developers, we
        attempted to understand the programmer's perception on who is
        responsible for ensuring end-users' security of the applications they
        develop. Results revealed majority of programmers perceive that they
        are responsible for the end-users' security of applications they
        develop. Furthermore, results showed that even though programmers
        aware of things they need to do to ensure end-users' security, they
        do not often follow them. We believe these results would change the
        current view on the role that different stakeholders of the software
        development process (i.e. researchers, security experts, programmers
        and Application Programming Interface (API) developers) have to play

        implement DM when they are not aware of the potential of data they

        can alternately emit and detect light using only an LED, two digital
        I/O pins and a single current limiting resistor. This technique is
        first applied to create a smart illumination system that uses a
        single LED as both light source and sensor. We then present several
        devices that use an LED as a generic wireless serial data port. An
        important implication of this work is that every LED connected to a
        microprocessor can be thought of as a wireless two-way communication
        port. We present this technology as a solution to the
        ``last centimeter problem'' because it permits disparate devices to
        communicate with each other simply and cheaply with minimal design
        modification.},

    abstract = {We revisit the idea of `terraforming' Mars --- changing its
        environment to be more Earth-like in a way that would allow
        terrestrial life (possibly including humans) to survive without the
        need for life-support systems --- in the context of what we know
        about Mars today. We want to answer the question of whether it is
        possible to mobilize gases present on Mars today in non-atmospheric
        reservoirs by emplacing them into the atmosphere, and increase the
        pressure and temperature so that plants or humans could survive at
        the surface. We ask whether this can be achieved considering
        realistic estimates of available volatiles, without the use of new
        technology that is well beyond today's capability. Recent
        observations have been made of the loss of Mars's atmosphere to space
        by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission probe and the
        Mars Express spacecraft, along with analyses of the abundance of
        carbon-bearing minerals and the occurrence of \ce{CO2} in polar ice
        from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Odyssey spacecraft.
        These results suggest that there is not enough \ce{CO2} remaining on
        Mars to provide significant greenhouse warming were the gas to be
        emplaced into the atmosphere; in addition, most of the \ce{CO2} gas
        in these reservoirs is not accessible and thus cannot be readily
        mobilized. As a result, we conclude that terraforming Mars is not
        possible using present-day technology.},

        extending the ring confidential transaction with an additional
        commitment to a colour and a publicly verifiable proof of
        conservation. With our coloured confidential ring signatures, new
        token types can be introduced and transferred by any participant
        using the same sized anonymity set as single-token privacy aware
        block-chains. Thereby, our system facilitates tracking assets on an

        stopping their experiments based on the p-value of the treatment
        effect. Our data contains 2,101 commercial experiments in which
        experimenters can track the magnitude and significance level of the
        effect every day of the experiment. We use a regression discontinuity
        design to detect p-hacking, i.e., the causal effect of reaching a
        particular p-value on stopping behavior.

        Experimenters indeed p-hack, especially for positive effects.
        Specifically, about 57\% of experimenters p-hack when the experiment
        reaches 90\% confidence. Furthermore, approximately 70\% of the
        effects are truly null, and p-hacking increases the false discovery
        rate (FDR) from 33\% to 42\% among experiments p-hacked at 90\%
        confidence. Assuming that false discoveries cause experimenters to
        stop exploring for more effective treatments, we estimate the
        expected cost of a false discovery to be a loss of 1.95\% in lift,
        which corresponds to the 76th percentile of observed lifts.},

        Internet of Skills. What next? We conjecture that in 15--20 years
        from now we will have the Internet of Neurons, a new Internet
        paradigm in which humans will be able to connect bi-directionally to
        the net using only their brain. The Internet of Neurons will provide
        new, tremendous opportunities thanks to constant access to unlimited
        information. It will empower all those outside of the technical
        industry, actually it will empower all human beings, to access and
        use technological products and services as everybody will be able to
        connect, even without possessing a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone.
        The Internet of Neurons will thus ultimately complete the currently
        still immature democratization of knowledge and technology. But it
        will also bring along several enormous challenges, especially
        concerning security (as well as privacy and trust).

        In this paper we speculate on the worldwide deployment of the
        Internet of Neurons by 2038 and brainstorm about its disruptive
        impact, discussing the main technological (and neurological)
        breakthroughs required to enable it, the new opportunities it
        provides and the security challenges it raises. We also elaborate on
        the novel system models, threat models and security properties that
        are required to reason about privacy, security and trust in the
        Internet of Neurons.},

        obliviously---{\it i.e.}\ with a sequence of memory accesses that

    abstract = {Finding a balance between privacy and utility, allowing
        researchers and businesses to use data for good while protecting
        people's privacy, is one of the biggest challenge we face today. A
        large body of research has shown the limits of the traditional
        anonymization (or de-identification) model prompting the use of
        question and answer or query-based systems. Diffix is a query-based
        system developed by Aircloak using the concept of ``sticky noise''
        to protect people's privacy. We here present an attack on Diffix that
        exploits the structure of its sticky noise to infer private
        attributes of people in the dataset. We believe this vulnerability to
        be serious, allowing us to accurately infer private information of
        users with little background knowledge. While we share Diffix's
        creators view that we need to take a fresh look at building practical
        privacy-preserving systems, we believe this requires a layered
        security approach and fully open tools and discussions. Patented and
        proprietary code is unlikely to be sufficient to truly help us find a
        balance between the great potential of data and the basic human right
        of privacy.},

        of one channel with respect to the other. The two quantities are
        based on the notion of generalized weighted Le Cam deficiencies and
        differ on whether one channel can approximate the other by a
        randomization at either its input or output. We relate the proposed
        quantities to an existing measure of unique information which we call
        the minimum-synergy unique information. We give an operational
        interpretation of the latter in terms of an upper bound on the
        one-way secret key rate and discuss the role of the unique
        informations in the context of nonnegative mutual information
        decompositions into unique, redundant and synergistic components.},

        researchers suggest to add example code to the documentation. Aim: We
        wanted to create a free platform for cryptographic code examples that
        improves the usability and security of created applications by non
        security experts. Method: We created the open-source web platform
        CryptoExamples and conducted a controlled experiment where 58 students
        added symmetric encryption to a Java program. We then measured the
        usability and security. Results: The participants who used the
        platform were not only significantly more effective (+73 \%) but also
        their code contained significantly less possible security
        vulnerabilities (-66 \%). Conclusions: With CryptoExamples the gap
        between hard to change API documentation and the need for complete
        and secure code examples can be closed. Still, the platform needs
        more code examples.},

    abstract = {By comparing cryptocurrencies with other existing payment
        methods, including banknotes and bank cards, it is clear that the use
        of Bitcoin and its competitors (Ethereum, \dots) is almost
        insignificant in world trade. We may also note that these
        cryptocurrencies have become tools of speculation, which is the
        antithesis of their primary purpose.

        Based essentially on the security of electronic signatures, the Ecash
        introduced here will put the users back to the center of the game and
        exclude miners and their enormous waste of power energy. Thus, the
        purpose of this paper is to show that even a piece of paper can be
        recycled into a secure Ecash, while remaining environmentally
        friendly. Hence, we create here a cryptocurrency that would use a
        slight modification of the current banknotes to set up anonymous
        electronic transactions. By trading with banknotes, we mechanically
        transfer ownership of the paper money from one owner to another,
        hence, in this scheme, we introduce the notion of ownership transfer.
        It implies that at each transaction the elements allowing to
        authenticate the Ecash does not change, while the ownership
        certificate will change since the Ecash is transfer towards someone
        else.},

        We validate our analysis against a tagged data-set of networks for
        which we determined ground truth through interviews with the drive
        owners. In the resulting social networks, we find that classical

        meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the hunting behaviour and social
        hierarchy of grey wolves in nature. This paper analyses the use of
        chaos theory in this algorithm to improve its ability to escape local
        optima by replacing the key parameters by chaotic variables. The
        optimal choice of chaotic maps is then used to apply the Chaotic Grey
        Wolf Optimizer (CGWO) to the problem of factoring a large semi prime
        into its prime factors. Assuming the number of digits of the factors
        to be equal, this is a computationally difficult task upon which the
        RSA-cryptosystem relies. This work proposes the use of a new
        objective function to solve the problem and uses the CGWO to optimize
        it and compute the factors. It is shown that this function performs
        better than its predecessor for large semi primes and CGWO is an
        efficient algorithm to optimize it.},

        We are motivated from QR codes that can be considered GPWs, are
        successfully applied in today's world. However, one need such GPWs
        that can be use conveniently and have higher level security in
        information networks. We aim to GPWs for mobile devices with touch
        screen. No more researching papers of GPWs by means of techniques of
        graph theory that are already used in a wide range of scientific
        areas, especially, dynamic networks. Our investigation is devoted to
        designing new type of graphical passwords by methods of graph theory,
        such as various topological structures and colorings (labellings). We
        develop the idea of ``topological structure plus number theory'' in
        maximal planar graphs, and provide new techniques for designing new
        type of GPWs, and furthermore we do theoretical analysis on these new
        type of GPWs.}

    howpublished = {arXiv:1806.03160 [cs.CR]},
    abstract = {Most encrypted data formats, such as PGP, leak substantial
        metadata in their plaintext headers, such as format version,
        encryption schemes used, the number of recipients who can decrypt the
        data, and even the identities of those recipients. This leakage can
        pose security and privacy risks, {\it e.g.}, by revealing the full
        membership of a group of collaborators from a single encrypted E-mail
        between two of them, or enabling an eavesdropper to fingerprint the
        precise encryption software version and configuration the sender used
        and to facilitate targeted attacks against specific endpoint software
        weaknesses. We propose to improve security and privacy hygiene by
        designing future encrypted data formats such that no one without a
        relevant decryption key learns \emph{anything at all} from a
        ciphertext apart from its length---and learns as little as possible
        even from that.

        To achieve this goal we present \emph{Padded Uniform Random Blobs} or
        PURBs, an encrypted format functionally similar to PGP but strongly
        minimizing a ciphertext's leakage via metadata or length. A PURB is
        indistinguishable from a uniform random bit-string to an observer
        without a decryption key. Legitimate recipients can efficiently
        decrypt the PURB even when it is encrypted for any number of
        recipients' public keys and/or passwords, and when those public keys
        are of different cryptographic schemes. PURBs use a novel padding
        scheme to reduce potential information leakage via the ciphertext's
        length $L$ to the asymptotic minimum of $O(\log_2(\log_2(L)))$ bits,
        comparable to padding to a power of two, but with much lower padding
        overhead of at most 12\% which decreases further with large
        payloads.},

        playground for the elucidation of many physical principles. The field
        of cavity optomechanics aims to create these states through laser
        cooling and by minimizing state decoherence. Here we demonstrate
        simultaneous optical trapping and rotation of a birefringent
        microparticle in vacuum using a circularly polarized trapping laser
        beam---a microgyroscope. We show stable rotation rates up to
        \SI{5}{\mega\hertz}. Coupling between the rotational and
        translational degrees of freedom of the trapped microgyroscope leads
        to the observation of positional stabilization in effect cooling the
        particle to \SI{40}{\kelvin}. We attribute this cooling to the
        interaction between the gyroscopic directional stabilization and the
        optical trapping field.},

        regulate, creating a ``revolving door'' between government and the

        the US Patent and Trademark Office. We find that patent examiners
        grant significantly more patents to the firms that later hire them
        and that much of this leniency extends to prospective employers.
        These effects are strongest in years when firms are actively hiring,
        and these relationships hold for the intensive margin of intellectual
        property protection. Ultimately, this leads the agency to issue lower
        quality patents, which we measure in citations. Together with other
        supporting evidence, we argue these results are suggestive of

        `beyond Moore' electronic devices. In this paper we give an
        engineering-minded survey of oscillator-based computing
        architectures, with the goal of understanding their promise and
        limitations for next-generation computing. We will mostly discuss
        non-Boolean, neurally-inspired computing concepts and put the
        emphasis on hardware and on circuits where the oscillators are
        realized from emerging, nanoscale building blocks. Despite all the

        very few clear-cut arguments about the possible benefits of using
        oscillators in place of other analog nonlinear circuit elements. In
        this survey we will argue for finding the rationale of using
        oscillatory building blocks and call for benchmarking studies that
        compare oscillatory computing circuits to level-based (analog)

        has received little attention in the literature to date. Current
        approaches are ad-hoc and rely on assumptions about an adversary's
        auxiliary knowledge which makes it difficult to reason about the
        privacy properties of these methods. Differential privacy is a
        well-known and robust privacy approach, but its reliance on the
        notion of adjacency between datasets has prevented its application to
        text document privacy. However, generalised differential privacy
        permits the application of differential privacy to arbitrary datasets
        endowed with a metric and has been demonstrated on problems involving
        the release of individual data points. In this paper we show how to
        apply generalised differential privacy to author obfuscation by
        utilising existing tools and methods from the stylometry and natural

        unacceptable, or a customer complains about accessibility or
        performance of a platform, the importance of logs increases
        significantly. Depending on the scope of the issue, all departments,
        including management, customer support, and even the actual customer,
        may turn to logs to find out what has happened, how it has happened,
        and who is responsible for the issue. The party at fault may be
        motivated to tamper the logs to hide their fault. Given the number of
        logs that are generated by the Cloud solutions, there are many
        tampering possibilities. While tamper detection solution can be used
        to detect any changes in the logs, we argue that critical nature of
        logs calls for immutability. In this work, we propose a
        blockchain-based log system, called Logchain, that collects the logs
        from different providers and avoids log tampering by sealing the logs
        cryptographically and adding them to a hierarchical ledger, hence,

        protocol has recently been adopted by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger,
        and Google Allo among many others; the first two of these have at
        least 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon
        security properties (such as ``future secrecy'' or ``post-compromise
        security''), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which
        session keys are updated with every message sent. Despite its
        importance and novelty, there has been little to no academic analysis
        of the Signal protocol.

        We conduct the first security analysis of Signal's Key Agreement and
        Double Ratchet as a multi-stage key exchange protocol. We extract
        from the implementation a formal description of the abstract
        protocol, and define a security model which can capture the
        ``ratcheting'' key update structure. We then prove the security of
        Signal's core in our model, demonstrating several standard security
        properties. We have found no major flaws in the design, and hope that
        our presentation and results can serve as a starting point for other
        analyses of this widely adopted protocol.},

        access controls that uses public key cryptography to secure large
        numbers of documents with arbitrarily large numbers of authorized
        users. Our approach uses a proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme to handle
        the problems typical of public key cryptography including key
        management, rotation, and revocation, in a highly scalable way, while
        providing end-to-end encryption and provable access.

        In this paper we describe a system based on this approach. We call it
        an orthogonal access control system, because it allows the decision
        about the groups to which to encrypt a piece of data to be made
        independently and asynchronously from the decision about who belongs

    journal = {Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology},
    abstract = {We review the salient evidence consistent with or predicted
        by the Hoyle--Wickramasinghe (H--W) thesis of Cometary (Cosmic)
        Biology. Much of this physical and biological evidence is
        multifactorial. One particular focus are the recent studies which
        date the emergence of the complex retroviruses of vertebrate lines at
        or just before the Cambrian Explosion of $\sim 500$ Ma. Such viruses
        are known to be plausibly associated with major evolutionary genomic
        processes. We believe this coincidence is not fortuitous but is
        consistent with a key prediction of H--W theory whereby major
        extinction-diversification evolutionary boundaries coincide with
        virus-bearing cometary-bolide bombardment events. A second focus is
        the remarkable evolution of intelligent complexity (Cephalopods)
        culminating in the emergence of the Octopus. A third focus concerns
        the micro-organism fossil evidence contained within meteorites as
        well as the detection in the upper atmosphere of apparent incoming
        life-bearing particles from space. In our view the totality of the
        multifactorial data and critical analyses assembled by Fred Hoyle,
        Chandra Wickramasinghe and their many colleagues since the 1960s
        leads to a very plausible conclusion---life may have been seeded here
        on Earth by life-bearing comets as soon as conditions on Earth
        allowed it to flourish (about or just before 4.1 Billion years ago);
        and living organisms such as space-resistant and space-hardy
        bacteria, viruses, more complex eukaryotic cells, fertilised ova and
        seeds have been continuously delivered ever since to Earth so being
        one important driver of further terrestrial evolution which has
        resulted in considerable genetic diversity and which has led to the
        emergence of mankind.},

        released new guidelines in June of 2017 that recommended new

        guidelines is a requirement that verifiers should check if a user's
        supplied password is compromised---that is, already listed in
        previous breach corpuses. Using a corpus of 320M breached passwords,
        the researcher collected information regarding Asia Pacific College
        students using breached passwords. Correlating these with academic
        performance data from each student's grade history, the researcher
        found that the students in the highest GPA tier had the lowest \% of
        terrible passwords. The difference is not that large, however, which
        suggests that weak passwords aren't mainly because of any level of
        intelligence, nor should it be assumed that highly-intelligent users
        will have good passwords.},

        (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) state of photons that do not

        opposed to an entanglement in space, provides the crucial quantum
        advantage. All the subcomponents of this system have already been
        shown to be experimentally realized. Perhaps more shockingly, our
        encoding procedure can be interpreted as non-classically influencing
        the past; hence this decentralized quantum blockchain can be viewed
        as a quantum networked time machine.},

        Nevertheless, this paper demonstrates the actual construction of just
        such a system. It then discusses why this peculiar type of classical
        system, unlike any other, behaves in this ``weird'' fashion. The
        reason illuminates the Physics Community's profound misunderstanding
        of exactly what a single, classical ``bit'' is, in the context of
        Shannon's Information Theory, and the resulting misinterpretation of
        the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the EPR paradox.},

    howpublished = {arXiv preprint 1804.05246 [quant-ph]},
    abstract = {Summoning is a task between two parties, Alice and Bob, with
        distributed networks of agents in space-time. Bob gives Alice a
        random quantum state, known to him but not her, at some point. She is
        required to return the state at some later point, belonging to a
        subset defined by communications received from Bob at other points.
        Many results about summoning, including the impossibility of
        unrestricted summoning tasks and the necessary conditions for
        specific types of summoning tasks to be possible, follow directly
        from the quantum nocloning theorem and the relativistic
        no-superluminal-signalling principle. The impossibility of cloning
        devices can be derived from the impossibility of superluminal
        signalling and the projection postulate, together with assumptions
        about the devices' location-independent functioning. In this
        qualified sense, known summoning results follow from the causal
        structure of space-time and the properties of quantum measurements.
        Bounds on the fidelity of approximate cloning can be similarly
        derived. Bit commitment protocols and other cryptographic protocols
        based on the no-summoning theorem can thus be proven secure against
        some classes of post-quantum but non-signalling adversaries.},

    abstract = {We present a prototype CMOS active pixel that is capable of
        simultaneous imaging and energy harvesting without introducing
        additional in-plane p-n junctions. The prototype pixel uses a
        vertical $\text{p}^+/\text{n}_\text{well}/\text{p}_\text{sub}$
        junction that is available in standard CMOS processes. Unlike the
        conventional CMOS electron-based imaging pixels, where the
        $\text{n}_\text{well}$ region is used as a sensing node for image
        capture, we adopted a hole-based imaging technique, while exploiting
        the $\text{n}_\text{well}$ region for energy harvesting at a high
        fill-factor of $>94\%$. To verify the feasibility, CMOS image sensors
        are fabricated and characterized. We successfully demonstrated that
        the energy harvesting can be achieved with a power density of 998
        pW/klux/mm\textsuperscript{2}, while capturing images at 74.67
        pJ/pixel. The fabricated prototype device has achieved the highest
        power density among the recent state-of-the-art works and can
        self-sustain its image capturing operation at 15 fps without external
        power sources above $\sim 60$ klux of illumination.},

    abstract = {Along with pressure and temperature, the magnetic field is
        one of the physical parameters that are used for the investigation of
        matter. It is an important tool for investigating magnetic and
        electronic properties from both the microscopic and macroscopic
        points of view. The interaction energy of a substance with a magnetic
        field, {\it i.e.}\ Zeeman energy or Landau energy, is small even at a
        field of \SI{2}{\tesla} as can be provided by a conventional
        electromagnet. Compared with the inner energies of a substance,
        magnetic fields as high as possible have been required for obtaining
        fine and detailed information on the internal structure and energy
        states. Due to the strong Maxwell stress, however, it is quite
        difficult to obtain a magnetic field higher than \SI{50}{\tesla} and
        much effort has been dedicated to the development of magnets ever
        since the laboratory electromagnet was invented.

        The purpose of this paper is to describe the physical effects that
        have been investigated and the phenomena that have been revealed
        using high magnetic fields, as well as the development of magnet
        technology and measurement technology. In addition, application to
        materials processing is mentioned as an active application of high

    abstract = {In this work, we examine the feasibility of secure and
        undetectable point-to-point communication in a world where
        governments can read all the encrypted communications of their
        citizens. We consider a world where the only permitted method of
        communication is via a government-mandated encryption scheme,
        instantiated with government-mandated keys. Parties cannot simply
        encrypt ciphertexts of some other encryption scheme, because citizens
        caught trying to communicate outside the government's knowledge
        (e.g., by encrypting strings which do not appear to be natural
        language plaintexts) will be arrested. The one guarantee we suppose
        is that the government mandates an encryption scheme which is
        semantically secure against outsiders: a perhaps reasonable
        supposition when a government might consider it advantageous to
        secure its people's communication against foreign entities. But then,
        what good is semantic security against an adversary that holds all
        the keys and has the power to decrypt?

        We show that even in the pessimistic scenario described, citizens can
        communicate securely and undetectably. In our terminology, this
        translates to a positive statement: all semantically secure
        encryption schemes support subliminal communication. Informally, this
        means that there is a two-party protocol between Alice and Bob where
        the parties exchange ciphertexts of what appears to be a normal
        conversation even to someone who knows the secret keys and thus can
        read the corresponding plaintexts. And yet, at the end of the
        protocol, Alice will have transmitted her secret message to Bob. Our
        security definition requires that the adversary not be able to tell
        whether Alice and Bob are just having a normal conversation using the
        mandated encryption scheme, or they are using the mandated encryption
        scheme for subliminal communication.

        Our topics may be thought to fall broadly within the realm of
        steganography: the science of hiding secret communication within
        innocent-looking messages, or cover objects. However, we deal with
        the non-standard setting of an adversarially chosen distribution of
        cover objects (i.e., a stronger-than-usual adversary), and we take
        advantage of the fact that our cover objects are ciphertexts of a
        semantically secure encryption scheme to bypass impossibility results
        which we show for broader classes of steganographic schemes. We give
        several constructions of subliminal communication schemes under the
        assumption that key exchange protocols with pseudorandom messages
        exist (such as Diffie-Hellman, which in fact has truly random
        messages). Each construction leverages the assumed semantic security
        of the adversarially chosen encryption scheme, in order to achieve
        subliminal communication.},

        communiction (VLC) system employing red and green laser pointer

        Improved performance of BER of $<10^{-9}, as well as better and

        LPL features create a new category of good performance with

        isolated, air-gapped computers to nearby smartphones via covert
        magnetic signals. The proposed covert channel works even if a
        smartphone is kept inside a Faraday shielding case, which aims to
        block any type of inbound and outbound wireless communication
        (Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth, etc.). The channel also works if the
        smartphone is set in airplane mode in order to block any
        communication with the device. We implement a malware that controls
        the magnetic fields emanating from the computer by regulating
        workloads on the CPU cores. Sensitive data such as encryption keys,
        passwords, or keylogging data is encoded and transmitted over the
        magnetic signals. A smartphone located near the computer receives
        the covert signals with its magnetic sensor. We present technical
        background, and discuss signal generation, data encoding, and signal
        reception. We show that the proposed covert channel works from a
        user-level process, without requiring special privileges, and can
        successfully operate from within an isolated virtual machine (VM).},

        have focused on estimating species richness. However, this is but
        one component of biodiversity, and others, such as numbers of
        individuals or biomass, are at least as poorly known and just as
        important to quantify. Here, we use a variety of methods to
        estimate the global number of individuals for a single taxon,
        birds. The different methods yield surprisingly consistent
        estimates of a global bird population of between 200 billion and
        400 billion individuals (1 billion=$10^9$). We discuss some of the
        implications of this figure.},

    abstract = {The Dover inherently secure processor being developed at
        Draper extends a conventional CPU (we use an open-source RISC-V
        implementation) with a Policy EXecution coprocessor (PEX). The PEX
        maintains metadata at the granularity of every word accessible by
        the application processor (AP), including registers, and the PEX
        enforces software-defined policies at the granularity of each
        instruction executed by the AP CPU. Hardware interlocks enforce
        strict separation between user-land code \& data and policy-related
        code \& data. Dover achieves high performance by using caches for
        acceptable combinations of instructions and associated metadata.
        Dover maintains flexibility with respect to the host AP CPU by
        imposing minimal changes to the AP CPU. A Dover system, in
        conjunction with a Dover-specialized kernel and modifications tor
        the GCC toolchain, can implement a wide range of security and
        safety policies on top of existing C-based applications.},

        other states' fear of domination. This article asks whether or not
        the internet needs the United States to play a similar role. If so,
        Washington should pursue policies designed to strengthen internet
        security while eschewing espionage and cyberattacks that rely on
        some degree of internet insecurity. If not, it can go on the
        offensive without fear of undermining the system as a whole. We
        examine the technical and political fallout from revealed offensive
        cyberoperations to assess the relative fragility of the internet.
        Our findings suggest that it is relatively resilient.},

    abstract = {The security of billions of devices worldwide depends on the
        security and robustness of the mainline Linux kernel. However, the
        increasing number of kernel-specific vulnerabilities, especially
        memory safety vulnerabilities, shows that the kernel is a popular
        and practically exploitable target. Two major causes of memory
        safety vulnerabilities are reference counter overflows (temporal
        memory errors) and lack of pointer bounds checking (spatial memory
        errors).

        To succeed in practice, security mechanisms for critical systems
        like the Linux kernel must also consider performance and
        deployability as critical design objectives. We present and
        systematically analyze two such mechanisms for improving memory
        safety in the Linux kernel: (a) an overflow-resistant reference
        counter data structure designed to accommodate typical reference
        counter usage in kernel source code, and (b) runtime pointer bounds
        checking using Intel MPX in the kernel.},

        as writing in memory with defective cells [1][2] is a relevant
        information-theoretical model for a specific case of passive warden
        steganography when the sender embeds a secret message into a subset
        $C$ of the cover object $X$ without sharing $C$ with the recipient.
        The set $C$, also called the selection channel, could be arbitrary,
        determined by the sender from the cover object using a
        deterministic, pseudo-random, or a truly random process. We call
        this steganography ``writing on wet paper'' and realize it using a
        simple variable-rate random linear code that gives the sender a
        convenient flexibility and control over the embedding process and
        is thus suitable for practical implementation. The importance of
        the wet paper scenario for covert communication is discussed within
        the context of adaptive steganography and perturbed quantization
        steganography [3]. Heuristic arguments supported by tests using
        blind steganalysis [4] indicate that the wet paper steganography
        provides improved steganographic security and is less vulnerable
        to steganalytic attacks compared to existing methods with shared
        selection channels.},

        cryptosystems over finite fields typically make the assumption that
        any domain parameters they are presented with are trustworthy, i.e.,
        the parameters implement cyclic groups where the discrete logarithm
        problem is assumed to be hard.

        An informal and widespread justification for this seemingly exists
        that says validating parameters at run time is too computationally
        expensive relative to the perceived risk of a server sabotaging the
        privacy of its own connection. In this paper we explore this trust
        assumption and examine situations where it may not always be
        justified.

        We conducted an investigation of discrete logarithm domain
        parameters in use across the Internet and discovered evidence of a
        multitude of potentially backdoored moduli of unknown order in TLS
        and STARTTLS spanning numerous countries, organizations, and
        protocols. Although our disclosures resulted in a number of
        organizations taking down suspicious parameters, we argue the
        potential for TLS backdoors is systematic and will persist until
        either until better parameter hygiene is taken up by the community,
        or finite field based cryptography is eliminated altogether.},

        cognitive deficits including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
        It is unclear whether these are related to cognitive/mental
        experiences and awareness during CPR. Despite anecdotal reports the
        broad range of cognitive/mental experiences and awareness associated
        with CPR has not been systematically studied.

        \emph{Methods:} The incidence and validity of awareness together
        with the range, characteristics and themes relating to
        memories/cognitive processes during CA was investigated through a 4
        year multi-center observational study using a three stage
        quantitative and qualitative interview system. The feasibility of
        objectively testing the accuracy of claims of visual and auditory
        awareness was examined using specific tests. The outcome measures
        were (1) awareness/memories during CA and (2) objective verification
        of claims of awareness using specific tests.

        \emph{Results:} Among 2060 CA events, 140 survivors completed stage 1
        interviews, while 101 of 140 patients completed stage 2 interviews.
        46\% had memories with 7 major cognitive themes: fear; animals/plants;
        bright light; violence/persecution; deja-vu; family; recalling events
        post-CA and 9\% had NDEs, while 2\% described awareness with explicit
        recall of `seeing' and `hearing' actual events related to their
        resuscitation. One had a verifiable period of conscious awareness
        during which time cerebral function was not expected.},

        approach should be taken by AVs in unavoidable accident
        scenarios. We thus assume that AVs are equipped with what we

        ethically customise their AVs, namely, to choose between
        different settings corresponding to different moral approaches
        or principles. Accordingly, AVs would be entrusted with
        implementing users' ethical choices, while
        manufacturers/programmers would be tasked with enabling the
        user's choice and ensuring implementation by the AV.},

        are backward wave oscillators particularly suitable in applications
        requiring a tube with a very wide electronic tuning range and moderate
        power output. A survey of backward-wave operation is given. Theoretical
        results on the starting conditions are shown to compare favorably with
        experimental values. The effects of reflections are discussed and are
        shown to be very small only when the delay line has properly matched
        terminals. Approximate expressions for efficiency and frequencypushing
        are derived. Design and performance data are given for a series of
        tubes now in production, each of which covers about one octave in
        frequency, providing total frequency coverage from 1,000 to 12,000 mc.
        The maximum beam voltage of any of the tubes in the series is 1,500
        volts. The rf power output of the series is 100 to 1,000 milliwatts.
        Data on delay lines, gun structures and focusing are given, and results
        of tests on 100 tubes are tabulated.},

    year = 2017,
    month = {13th October},
    howpublished = {COMP 4600 presentation at the University of Denver},
    abstract = {Matrix Multiplication (MM) is a fundamental operation of
        modern computing, and an important component of algorithms that
        solve problems in linear algebra, combinatorics, graph theory, and
        machine learning, to name a few. MM's computational time dominates
        their total time: such problems can be solved fast if MM is solved
        fast.

        Directly applying MM's definition to two $n\by n$ matrices yields a
        straightforward algorithm in $O(n^3)$. In 1969, Volker Strassen
        shook the algorithmic world with his paper ``Gaussian elimination
        is not optimal'', by describing a sub-cubic construction in
        $O(n^{\log_7})$. A worldwide effort in search of the optimal
        algorithm ensued.

        In the early 1970s, it was expected that the cubic time algorithm
        would soon be accelerated to enable MM in nearly quadratic
        arithmetic time, with some far-fetched implications.  While
        pursuing this goal, mainstream research had its focus on the
        decrease of the classical exponent 3 towards its lower bound 2,
        disregarding the growth of the input size required to support this
        decrease. Combinations of novel ideas and sophisticated techniques
        reduced the exponent to its benchmark value of about 2.38, but the
        resulting MM algorithms improved the straightforward one only for
        inputs of immense sizes. Today, data communication complexity,
        rather than arithmetic complexity, has become the bottleneck of
        computations.

        We will describe the path traveled to decrease the exponent below
        2.5, and reassess the route for fast MM in present times.

        such that each number in the sequence differs from the preceding
        number in only one bit. We present two methods to compute Gray codes
        containing exactly $n$ numbers in the range $0$ to $n-1$---that is,
        a permutation of $0,1,\ldots ,n-1$ in which each number differs from
        the preceding number in only one bit---where $n$ is unconstrained.
        The first method produces a Gray code that is not cyclic: the first
        and last numbers in the sequence differ in more than one bit. The
        second method produces a cyclic Gray code if $n$ is even, so that
        the first and last numbers differ in only one bit, at the expense of
        a slightly more complicated procedure. Both methods are based on the
        standard binary reflected Gray code and, as in the binary reflected
        Gray code, each number in the output sequence can be computed in a
        constant number of word operations given just its index in the

        simulations for a large number of important problems. The answer to
        the question{\textemdash}whether there is a fundamental obstruction
        to such a sign-free representation in generic quantum
        systems{\textemdash}remains unclear. Focusing on systems with bosonic
        degrees of freedom, we show that quantized gravitational responses
        appear as obstructions to local sign-free QMC. In condensed matter
        physics settings, these responses, such as thermal Hall conductance,
        are associated with fractional quantum Hall effects. We show that
        similar arguments also hold in the case of spontaneously broken
        time-reversal (TR) symmetry such as in the chiral phase of a
        perturbed quantum Kagome antiferromagnet. The connection between
        quantized gravitational responses and the sign problem is also
        manifested in certain vertex models, where TR symmetry is preserved.},

    abstract = {Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to
        believe that events and power relations are secretly manipulated
        by certain clandestine groups and organisations. Many of these
        ostensibly explanatory conjectures are non-falsifiable, lacking
        in evidence or demonstrably false, yet public acceptance remains
        high. Efforts to convince the general public of the validity of
        medical and scientific findings can be hampered by such narratives,
        which can create the impression of doubt or disagreement in areas
        where the science is well established. Conversely, historical
        examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult
        for people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious
        assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathematical model
        for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time, which yields
        failure probability for any given conspiracy. Parameters for the
        model are estimated from literature examples of known scandals,
        and the factors influencing conspiracy success and failure are
        explored. The model is also used to estimate the likelihood of
        claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are
        namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax,
        vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being
        suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict
        that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the most
        generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of active
        participants---the results of this model suggest that large
        conspiracies ($\ge 1000$ agents) quickly become untenable and prone
        to failure. The theory presented here might be useful in
        counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences of bogus and
        anti-science narratives, and examining the hypothetical conditions
        under which sustainable conspiracy might be possible.},

        for smartphones. Often, sensitive personal information but also
        confidential business information is shared. End-to-end
        security is required to protect against wiretapping of voice
        calls. For such real-time communication, the ZRTP key-agreement
        protocol has been proposed. By verbally comparing a small number
        of on-screen characters or words, called Short Authentication
        Strings, the participants can be sure that no one is wiretapping
        the call. Since 2011, ZRTP is an IETF standard implemented in
        several VoIP clients. In this paper, we analyzed attacks on
        real-world VoIP systems, in particular those implementing the
        ZRTP standard. We evaluate the protocol compliance, error
        handling, and user interfaces of the most common ZRTP-capable
        VoIP clients. Our extensive analysis uncovered a critical
        vulnerability that allows wiretapping even though Short
        Authentication Strings are compared correctly. We discuss
        shortcomings in the clients' error handling and design of
        security indicators potentially leading to insecure connections.

        deep-rooted difference between waves and objects regarding
        temporal reversibility and particlelike objects. In
        nondissipative chaos, the dynamic of waves always remains time
        reversible, unlike that of particles. Here, we explore the
        dynamics of a waveparticle entity. It consists in a drop
        bouncing on a vibrated liquid bath, self-propelled and piloted
        by the surface waves it generates. This walker, in which there
        is an information exchange between the particle and the wave,
        can be analyzed in terms of a Turing machine with waves as the
        information repository. The experiments reveal that in this
        system, the drop can read information backwards while erasing
        it. The drop can thus backtrack on its previous trajectory. A
        transient temporal reversibility, restricted to the drop motion,
        is obtained in spite of the system being both dissipative and
        chaotic.},

    title = {{DRE-ip}: A Verifiable E-Voting Scheme without Tallying
        Authorities},
    year = 2016,
    booktitle = {{ESORICS} 2016},
    abstract = {Nearly all verifiable e-voting schemes require trustworthy
        authorities to perform the tallying operations. An exception is the
        DRE-i system which removes this requirement by pre-computing all
        encrypted ballots before the election using random factors that will
        later cancel out and allow the public to verify the tally after the
        election. While the removal of tallying authorities significantly
        simplifies election management, the pre-computation of ballots
        necessitates secure ballot storage, as leakage of precomputed ballots
        endangers voter privacy. In this paper, we address this problem and
        propose DRE-ip (DRE-i with enhanced privacy). Adopting a different
        design strategy, DRE-ip is able to encrypt ballots in real time in
        such a way that the election tally can be publicly verified without
        decrypting the cast ballots. As a result, DRE-ip achieves end-to-end
        verifiability without tallying authorities, similar to DRE-i, but
        with a significantly stronger guarantee on voter privacy. In the
        event that the voting machine is fully compromised, the assurance on
        tallying integrity remains intact and the information leakage is
        limited to the minimum: only the partial tally at the time of
        compromise is leaked.},

        lowest asymptotic time complexity for known pre-quantum factoring
        algorithms, assuming standard heuristics, is $L^{p+o(1)}$ where
        $p > 1.9$. The new time complexity is asymptotically worse than
        Shor's algorithm, but the qubit requirements are asymptotically
        better, so it may be possible to physically implement it sooner.},

        tools that allows users to focus on problem solving rather than on the
        peripheral activities of programming.

        Interactive software plays a vital role in reducing the burden on the
        user in describing the various information types. It prompts for
        information regarding identification of controllable parameters,
        generation of the goal scenario, and definition of performance
        criteria. Efforts are made to supply the user with as much information
        as is currently defined in the model base when eliciting responses.
        Further, the SES model specification language is specifically designed
        to support a library of model parts. Such a library serves as a
        corporate memory of past simulation studies and contains information on
        component behaviours, transaction sequences, and analysis rules.

        paper is on software issues such as color calibration and removal of
        scanner artifacts. With current scanner technology, the resulting
        camera system is capable of taking black\&white, color, or near-infrared
        photographs with up to 490 million pixels. Our analysis shows that we
        achieve actual optical resolutions close to the theoretical maximum,

        We present an account of the TLS standardisation narrative,
        examining the differences between the reactive standardisation
        process for TLS 1.2 and below, and the more proactive
        standardisation process for TLS 1.3. We explore the possible factors
        that have contributed to the shift in the TLS WG's design mindset,
        considering the protocol analysis tools available, the levels of
        academic involvement and the incentives governing relevant
        stakeholders at the time of standardisation. In an attempt to place
        TLS within the broader realm of standardisation, we perform a
        comparative analysis of standardisation models and discuss the

    abstract = {Robots are now associated with various aspects of our
        lives. These sophisticated machines have been increasingly used in
        different manufacturing industries and services sectors for decades.
        During this time, they have been a factor in causing significant harm
        to humans, prompting questions of liability. Industrial robots are
        presently regarded as products for liability purposes. In contrast,
        some commentators have proposed that robots be granted legal
        personality, with an overarching aim of exonerating the respective
        creators and users of these artefacts from liability. This article is
        concerned mainly with industrial robots that exercise some degree of
        self-control as programmed, though the creation of fully autonomous
        robots is still a long way off. The proponents of the robot's
        personality compare these machines generally with corporations, and
        sporadically with, inter alia, animals, and idols, in substantiating
        their arguments. This article discusses the attributes of legal
        personhood and the justifications for the separate personality of
        corporations and idols. It then demonstrates the reasons for refusal of
        an animal's personality. It concludes that robots are ineligible to be
        persons, based on the requirements of personhood.

        protect user passwords against server compromise by distributing the
        capability to verify passwords over multiple servers. Password
        verification is a single-round protocol and requires from each server
        only one exponentiation in a prime-order group. In spite of its
        simplicity, our scheme boasts security against dynamic and transient
        corruptions, meaning that servers can be corrupted at any time and can
        recover from corruption by going through a non-interactive key refresh
        procedure. The users' passwords remain secure against offline
        dictionary attacks as long as not all servers are corrupted within the
        same time period between refreshes. The only currently known scheme to
        achieve such strong security guarantees incurs the considerable cost of
        several hundred exponentiations per server. We prove our scheme secure
        in the universal composability model, which is well-known to offer
        important benefits for password-based primitives, under the gap
        one-more Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random-oracle model. Server
        initialization and refresh must take place in a trusted execution
        environment. Initialization additionally requires a secure message to
        each server,but the refresh procedure is non-interactive. We show that
        these requirements are easily met in practice by providing an example
        deployment architecture.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel technique for
        transmitting data over the power supply pins of an FPGA. Using
        this power side channel communication, a core inside the FPGA
        is able to send data to a receiver outside of the FPGA. Possible
        applications include monitoring, debugging, and watermarking.
        For the communication, we do not need any further resources,
        like IO pins or modifications of the board. We characterize the
        communication channel over the power pins and build a channel
        model. Furthermore, we present an encoding/decoding method
        which is independent of the board type and FPGA combination.
        With this approach, we achieve data rates up to 500 kbit/s.
        Finally, we provide a case study, which extends existing power
        watermarking techniques to the new encoding/decoding method
        and show experimental decoding results.

        this paper, we explore the some of the limits of FPGA side-channel
        communication. Specifically, we identify a previously unexplored
        capability that significantly increases both the potential benefits
        and risks associated with side-channel communication on an FPGA: an
        in-device receiver. We designed and implemented three new
        communication mechanisms: speed modulation, timing modulation and
        pin hijacking. These non-traditional interfacing techniques have the
        potential to provide reliable communication with an estimated
        maximum bandwidth of 3.3 bit/sec, 8 Kbits/sec, and 3.4 Mbits/sec,

        the latter studied at a pressure of \SI{495}{\giga\pascal}. We
        have measured the reflectance as a function of wavelength in the
        visible spectrum finding values as high as 0.90 from the metallic
        hydrogen. We have fit the reflectance using a Drude free electron
        model to determine the plasma frequency of \SI{30.1}{\electronvolt}
        at $\text{T=} \SI{5.5}{\K}, with a corresponding electron carrier
        density of $6.7\times 10^{23}$ particles/\si{\cubic\centi\metre},
        consistent with theoretical estimates. The properties are those
        of a metal. Solid metallic hydrogen has been produced in the

    abstract = {In practicable multi-level secure systems it is necessary
      occasionally to transfer information in violation of security policy.
      Machines for doing this reliably and securely are called cross domain
      solutions; systems incorporating them are cross domain systems. Data
      owners, especially in classified environments, tend to distrust other
      data owners, other systems and networks, their own users, and
      developers of cross domain solutions. Hence, data owners demand
      rigorous testing before they will allow their information into a cross
      domain system. The interests of data owners are represented by
      certifiers and accreditors, who test newly developed cross domain
      solutions and newly installed cross domain systems, respectively.
      Accreditors have the authority to grant approval to operate and the
      responsibility for accepting residual risk. Certification and
      accreditation have always been expensive and time consuming, but there
      are hidden inefficiencies and unexploited opportunities to predict the
      actions of accreditors and to control the cost of certification. Some
      case studies of successful and unsuccessful security certifications and
      accreditations were analysed using grounded theory methodology. It was
      discovered that inefficiency arises from conflation of the principle of
      defence in depth with the practice of independent verification and
      validation, resulting in an irresistible appearance of cost savings to
      managers with a possible explanation in the relative maturity of
      different levels of software engineering organisations with respect to
      policy, process, and procedures. It was discovered that there is a
      simple rule relating certifier findings to developer responses that
      predicts the duration of penetration testing and can be used to bound
      the schedule. An abstract model of cross domain system accreditation
      was developed that is sufficiently powerful to reason about collateral,
      compartmented, and international installations. It was discovered that
      the behaviour of accreditors satisfies the criteria for reliable
      signalling in the presence of asymmetric information due to Akerlof,
      Spence, and Stiglitz.},

        autonomous vehicle on open public roads. The video showcases
        participant reaction footage collected in the RRADS (Real Road
        Autonomous Driving Simulator). Although our study using this
        simulator did not use overt deception---the consent form clearly
        states that a licensed driver is operating the vehicle---the
        protocol was designed to support suspension of disbelief. Several
        participants who did not read the consent form clearly strongly
        believed that the vehicle was autonomous; this provides a lens onto
        the attitudes and concerns that people in real-world autonomous
        vehicles might have, and also points to ways that a protocol
        that deliberately used misdirection could gain ecologically valid
        reactions from study participants.},

        and GPS traces recorded with high temporal resolution, and find
        that time series of WiFi scans contain a strong latent location
        signal. In fact, due to inherent stability and low entropy of
        human mobility, it is possible to assign location to WiFi access
        points based on a very small number of GPS samples and then
        use these access points as location beacons. Using just one GPS
        observation per day per person allows us to estimate the location
        of, and subsequently use, WiFi access points to account for 80\%
        of mobility across a population. These results reveal a great
        opportunity for using ubiquitous WiFi routers for high-resolution
        outdoor positioning, but also significant privacy implications of
        such side-channel location tracking.},

        Framework},
    journal = {Submitted to journal; in preparation},
    year = 2015,
    abstract = {Security issues have become a significant barrier to
        the adoption of cloud computing services. Most existing security
        enhancements lack a definition of trust. Models for Trusted Clouds
        have been proposed, which establish Roots-of-Trust inside the cloud
        and vouch for the trustworthiness of the cloud services. However,
        these are often impractical due to cloud's dynamics and
        complexity. In this paper, we present the \emph{NeuronVisor}, an
        abstract \emph{Cloud Root-of-Trust (cRoT)} framework. NeuronVisor
        enforces decentralized attestations to capture trust dependency
        among interacting software components inside the cloud, and
        determines a single \emph{cRoT} for each cloud application. This
        \emph{cRoT} hides the cloud's internal by presenting a uniform
        interface for attesting to the trustworthiness of the entire cloud
        application and all its dependent services inside the cloud. Based
        on \emph{cRoT}, custom attestation delegates can be implemented to
        examine the properties of cloud resource without requiring excess
        exposure to the underlying implementation detail. Our simulations
        show that, for more than 98\% times, one interrogation to the
        dynamically formed \emph{cRoT} is able to identify the properties
        of more than 90\% of the nodes hosting a cloud application and its
        cloud TCB. Meanwhile, NeuronVisor achieves higher fault detection
        rate than the prevalent centralized cloud attestation scheme
        (CEN). It still achieves the same fault detection rate with CEN
        even when 90\% of the NeuronVisors are constantly tampered with and
        maliciously collaborating with each other.},

        identification from sensor fingerprints. To overcome the problem
        of acquiring a large number of cameras and taking the images,
        we utilized Flickr, an existing on-line image sharing site. In
        our experiment, we tested over one million images spanning 6896
        individual cameras covering 150 models. The gathered data provides
        practical estimates of false acceptance and false rejection rates,
        giving us the opportunity to compare the experimental data with
        theoretical estimates. We also test images against a database of
        fingerprints, simulating thus the situation when a forensic analyst
        wants to find if a given image belongs to a database of already
        known cameras. The experimental results set a lower bound on the
        performance and reveal several interesting new facts about camera
        fingerprints and their impact on error analysis in practice. We
        believe that this study will be a valuable reference for forensic
        investigators in their effort to use this method in court.},

    pages = {26--37},
    abstract = {This tutorial explains how photo-response non-uniformity
        (PRNU) of imaging sensors can be used for a variety of important
        digital forensic tasks, such as device identification, device
        linking, recovery of processing history, and detection of digital
        forgeries. The PRNU is an intrinsic property of all digital
        imaging sensors due to slight variations among individual pixels
        in their ability to convert photons to electrons. Consequently,
        every sensor casts a weak noise-like pattern onto every image it
        takes. This pattern, which plays the role of a sensor fingerprint,
        is essentially an unintentional stochastic spread-spectrum
        watermark that survives processing, such as lossy compression
        or filtering. This tutorial explains how this fingerprint can be
        estimated from images taken by the camera and later detected in
        a given image to establish image origin and integrity. Various

		transactions to be collected from EMV contactless credit and debit
		cards without the knowledge of the cardholder. The attack exploits
		a previously unreported vulnerability in EMV protocol, which allows
		EMV contactless cards to approve unlimited value transactions
		without the cardholder's PIN when the transaction is carried out in
		a foreign currency. For example, we have found that Visa credit
		cards will approve foreign currency transactions for any amount up
		to \EUR{999,999.99} with out the cardholder's PIN, this side-steps
		\pounds 20 contactless transaction limit in the UK. This paper
		outlines our analysis methodology that identified the flaw in the
		EMV protocol, and presents a scenario in which fraudulent
		transaction details are transmitted over the Internet to a rogue
		merchant who then uses the transaction data to take money from the
		victim's account. In reality, the criminals would choose a value
		between \EUR{100} and \EUR{200}, which is low enough to be within
		the victim's balance and not to raise suspicion, but high enough to
		make each attack worthwhile. The attack is novel in that it could
		be operated on a large scale with multiple attackers collecting
		fraudulent transactions for a central rogue merchant which can be
		located anywhere in the world where EMV payments are accepted.},

		the design of a simple floating solar reactor that eliminated the

		to photochemical reactions could be carried out in a single surfing
		session, while using the Pacific Ocean as the heat sink, has added
		an obvious fun component to the photochemical project. Conversion
		to 7-{\it cis}-$\beta$-ionol was quantitative, albeit at a slower
		rate because of the need to use a colorless photosensitizer.},

		designs on cave walls---a means of recording and transmitting
		symbolic codes in a durable manner---is recognized as a major
		cognitive step in human evolution. Considered exclusive to
		modern humans, this behavior has been used to argue in favor of
		significant cognitive differences between our direct ancestors
		and contemporary archaic hominins, including the Neanderthals.
		Here we present the first known example of an abstract pattern
		engraved by Neanderthals, from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar. It
		consists of a deeply impressed cross-hatching carved into the
		bedrock of the cave that has remained covered by an undisturbed
		archaeological level containing Mousterian artifacts made by
		Neanderthals and is older than 39 cal kyr BP. Geochemical
		analysis of the epigenetic coating over the engravings and
		experimental replication show that the engraving was made
		before accumulation of the archaeological layers, and that most
		of the lines composing the design were made by repeatedly and
		carefully passing a pointed lithic tool into the grooves,
		excluding the possibility of an unintentional or utilitarian
		origin ({\it e.g.}, food or fur processing). This discovery
		demonstrates the capacity of the Neanderthals for abstract
		thought and expression through the use of geometric forms.},

	abstract = {Financial crises appear throughout human history. While there are many
		schools of thought on what the actual causes of such crises are, it has been
		suggested that the creation of credit money might be a source of financial
		instability. We discuss how the credit mechanism in a system of fractional
		reserve banking leads to non-local transfers of purchasing power that also
		affect non-involved agents. To overcome this issue, we impose the local
		symmetry of time homogeneity on the monetary system. A bi-currency system of
		non-bank assets (money) and bank assets (antimoney) is considered. A payment
		is either made by passing on money or by receiving antimoney. As a result, a
		free floating exchange rate between non-bank assets and bank assets is
		established. Credit creation is replaced by the simultaneous transfer of money
		and antimoney at a negotiated exchange rate. This is in contrast to traditional
		discussions of full reserve banking, which stalls creditary lending. With money
		and antimoney, the problem of credit crunches is mitigated while a full time
		symmetry of the monetary system is maintained. As a test environment for such a
		monetary system, we discuss an economy of random transfers. Random transfers
		are a strong criterion to probe the stability of monetary systems. The analysis
		using statistical physics provides analytical solutions and confirms that a
		money--antimoney system could be functional. Equally important to the probing
		of the stability of such a monetary system is the question of how to implement
		the credit default dynamics. This issue remains open.},

	year = 2013,
	abstract = {Anonymous credentials provide a powerful tool for making
    assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation
    of today's anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted
    credential issuer---which is both a single point of failure and a target
    for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it
    challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the
    {\it ad hoc} network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where
    no single party can be trusted with this responsibility.  In this work we
    propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a
    trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the
    area of electronic cash and uses techniques---such as the calculation of a
    distributed transaction ledger---that are currently in widespread
    deployment in the Bitcoin payment system. Using this decentralized ledger
    and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of
    security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make
    flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees. Finally, we
    discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including
    resource management in {\it ad hoc} networks and prevention of Sybil
    attacks. We implement our scheme and measure its efficiency.},

    research has been conducted to more closely examine this assumption. This
    qualitative study explores how provenance affects end-users' trust in and
    reuse of data. Toward this end, the authors conducted semi-structured
    interviews with 17 proteomics researchers who interact with data from
    ProteomeCommons.org, a large scientific data repository. Empirical findings
    from this study suggest that provenance does help end-users gauge the
    trustworthiness of data and build their confidence in reusing data.
    However, provenance also needs to be accompanied by other kinds of
    information, including: more specific data quality information, the data
    itself, and author reputation information. Implications of this study
    stress the value of end-user studies in provenance research, specifically
    to assess the `real-world' impact of provenance encoded and communicated to
    end-users in systems.},

    incontestable necessity, current commodity systems do not support trusted
    path with any significant assurance. This paper presents a hypervisor-based
    design that enables a trusted path to bypass an untrusted operating-system,
    applications, and I/O devices, with a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
    We also suggest concrete I/O architectural changes that will simplify
    future trusted-path system design. Our system enables users to verify the
    states and configurations of one or more trusted-paths using a simple,
    secret-less, hand-held device. We implement a simple user-oriented trusted
    path as a case study.},

    demonstrate a Turing-complete execution environment driven solely by the
    IA32 architecture's interrupt handling and memory translation tables, in
    which the processor is trapped in a series of page faults and double
    faults, without ever successfully dispatching any instructions. The
    ``hard-wired'' logic of handling these faults is used to perform arithmetic
    and logic primitives, as well as memory reads and writes. This mechanism
    can also perform branches and loops if the memory is set up and mapped just
    right. We discuss the lessons of this execution model for future
    trustworthy architectures.},

	note = {URL: \URL{http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2130}},
	year = 2013,
	abstract = {Using public data (Forbes Global 2000) we show that the
    distribution of asset sizes for the largest global firms follows a Pareto
    distribution in an intermediate range that is ``interrupted'' by a sharp
    cutoff in its upper tail, which is totally dominated by financial firms.
    This contrasts with a large body of empirical\ literature which finds a
    Pareto distribution for firm sizes both across countries and over time.
    Pareto distributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of
    proportional random growth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale:
    this makes our evidence of an ``interrupted'' Pareto distribution all the
    more puzzling, because we provide evidence that financial firms in our
    sample operate in such a regime. We claim that the missing mass from the
    upper tail of the asset size distribution is a consequence of shadow
    banking activity and that it provides an estimate of the size of the shadow
    banking system. This estimate---that we propose as a shadow banking
    index---compares well with estimates of the Financial Stability Board until
    2009, but it shows a sharper rise in shadow banking activity after 2010.},

    examples of emotional display at work and notes the ritualized form of such
    display. The following sections provide working definitions for culture and
    emotion and tie the two together conceptually. The main body of the paper
    presents two brief ethnographies detailing how organizational life is
    structured to channel, mold, enhance, sustain, challenge, and otherwise
    influence the feeling or organizational members---toward the organization
    itself, others in the organization, customers of the organization, and
    crucially, themselves. Disneyland and High Technology Incorporated (a
    pseudonym) are the two organizations studied. The paper concludes by
    considering how these two organizational cultures are built and maintained,
    as well as the emotional costs and benefits membership within them
    provides.},

    hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are hypersensitive to a variety of
    inhibitory cytokines, one of which, TNF$\alpha$, can induce BM failure and
    clonal evolution in \emph{Fancc}-deficient mice. FANCC-deficient
    macrophages are also hypersensitive to TLR activation and produce
    TNF$\alpha$ in an unrestrained fashion. Reasoning that suppression of
    inhibitory cytokine production might enhance hematopoiesis, we screened
    small molecules using TLR agonist--stimulated FANCC- and Fanconi anemia,
    complementation group A (FANCA)--deficient macrophages containing an
    NF-$\kappa$B/AP-1--responsive reporter gene (\emph{SEAP}). Of the 75 small
    molecules screened, the p38 MAPK inhibitor BIRB 796 and dasatinib potently
    suppressed TLR8-dependent expression of the reporter gene. Fanconi anemia
    (FA) macrophages were hypersensitive to the TLR7/8 activator R848,
    overproducing SEAP and TNF$\alpha$ in response to all doses of the agonist.
    Low doses (50nM) of both agents inhibited p38 MAPK--dependent activation of
    MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and suppressed MK2-dependent TNF$\alpha$ production without
    substantially influencing TNF$\alpha$ gene transcription. Overproduction of
    TNF$\alpha$ by primary FA cells was likewise suppressed by these agents and
    involved inhibition of MK2 activation. Because MK2 is also known to
    influence production and/or sensitivity to 2 other suppressive factors
    (MIP-1$\alpha$ and IFN$\gamma$) to which FA hematopoietic progenitor cells
    are uniquely vulnerable, targeting of p38 MAPK in FA hematopoietic cells is
    a rational objective for preclinical evaluation.},

	abstract = {(Moore's Law applied to the complexity of life from mammals to
    fish to worms to eukaryotes to prokaryotes to zero suggests that life's
    complexity began around $9.7\pm 2.5$ billion years ago. The doubling time
    in this case is 376 million years.) An extrapolation of the genetic
    complexity of organisms to earlier times suggests that life began before
    the Earth was formed. Life may have started from systems with single
    heritable elements that are functionally equivalent to a nucleotide. The
    genetic complexity, roughly measured by the number of non-redundant
    functional nucleotides, is expected to have grown exponentially due to
    several positive feedback factors: gene cooperation, duplication of genes
    with their subsequent specialization, and emergence of novel functional
    niches associated with existing genes. Linear regression of genetic
    complexity on a log scale extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests
    the time of the origin of life 9.7 billion years ago. This cosmic time
    scale for the evolution of life has important consequences: life took ca. 5
    billion years to reach the complexity of bacteria; the environments in
    which life originated and evolved to the prokaryote stage may have been
    quite different from those envisaged on Earth; there was no intelligent
    life in our universe prior to the origin of Earth, thus Earth could not
    have been deliberately seeded with life by intelligent aliens; Earth was
    seeded by panspermia; experimental replication of the origin of life from
    scratch may have to emulate many cumulative rare events; and the Drake
    equation for guesstimating the number of civilizations in the universe is
    likely wrong, as intelligent life has just begun appearing in our universe.
    Evolution of advanced organisms has accelerated via development of
    additional information-processing systems: epigenetic memory, primitive
    mind, multicellular brain, language, books, computers, and Internet. As a
    result the doubling time of complexity has reached ca. 20 years. Finally,
    we discuss the issue of the predicted technological singularity and give a
    biosemiotics perspective on the increase of complexity.},

    intrinsic limitation that the target molecules must be obtained as single

    the crystallization of the sample. In our method, tiny crystals of porous
    complexes are soaked in a solution of the target, such that the complexes
    can absorb the target molecules. Crystallographic analysis clearly
    determines the absorbed guest structures along with the host frameworks.
    Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one tiny crystal of the
    complex, the required sample mass is of the nanogram gram order. We
    demonstrate that as little as about 80 nanograms of a sample is enough for
    the SCD analysis. In combination with high-performance liquid
    chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization of multiple
    fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography SCD
    analysis. Furthermore, we unambiguously determined the structure of a
    scarce marine natural product using only 5 micrograms of the compound.},

    Encryption (MLE), where the key under which encryption and decryption are
    performed is itself derived from the message. MLE provides a way to achieve
    secure de-duplication (space-efficient secure outsourced storage), a goal
    currently targeted by numerous cloud-storage providers. We provide
    definitions both for privacy and for a form of integrity that we call tag
    consistency. Based on this foundation, we make both practical and
    theoretical contributions. On the practical side, we provide ROM [(Random
    Oracle Model)] security analyses of a natural family of MLE schemes that
    includes deployed schemes. On the theoretical side the challenge is
    standard model solutions, and we make connections with deterministic
    encryption, hash functions secure on correlated inputs and the
    sample-then-extract paradigm to deliver schemes under different assumptions
    and for different classes of message sources. Our work shows that MLE is a
    primitive of both practical and theoretical interest.},

	year = 2012,
	pages = {19--28},
	abstract = {The difficulty of cross domain systems security accreditation
    lies inherent in the fact that, by definition, such systems always span at
    least one boundary between security domains controlled by different data
    owners. Consequently, approved solutions regularly encounter security
    testing criteria that represent the duplicated responsibility for residual
    risk of multiple security accreditors. Each data owner perceives a
    site-specific set of risks that would be desirable to mitigate, a
    technology-dependent set of risks that it is possible to mitigate, and a
    residual risk it is felt acceptable not to mitigate. Time and cost
    inefficiency in cross domain system accreditation are shown to originate
    from asymmetry of knowledge; Spence's criteria for market signalling are
    shown to hold by analogy for accreditor--accreditor communication in the
    presence of unequal or non-hierarchical security clearances. By formalising
    signals, an efficient route to agreement about the true level of residual
    risk might avoid repeated re-testing and redundant risk mitigations. If
    successful, the unnecessarily high cost of duplicated security test and
    evaluation effort could be greatly reduced.},

	abstract = {An automated interactive redaction assistant prototype was
    developed. Based on the Web 1T 5-gram corpus, a list of every unique word
    and phrase in the English language, up to five words in length, that were
    observed on the World Wide Web and collected by Google, Inc. in 2006, the
    CLOAK system automatically flags candidate words, phrases, sentences, and
    paragraphs in documents under review that are likely classified and
    suggests redactions to make the document unclassified. Security
    classification guidance from more than one guide at a time is figured into
    each suggested redaction. The probabilistic aspect of operation is in the
    way the system prioritizes its suggestions according to the measured rate
    of occurrence of words and phrases observed in the language's current
    usage, avoiding low likelihood phrases in favor of more probable
    interpretations. Collocation correlation of phrases in security
    classification guides has automatically discovered missing, incomplete, and
    inconsistent rules in existing security classification guides, promoting
    forward quality improvement of security classification guides. Performance
    from the earliest prototype software, implemented in Perl using associative
    arrays, was surprisingly acceptable and suggests that an alternative
    network representation, to be implemented using the map-reduce algorithm on
    a high performance cluster, would have improved capacity, depth, accuracy,
    and speed.},

    birds are produced by nanoscale arrays of melanin-containing organelles
    (melanosomes). Data relevant to the evolution of these colors and the
    properties of melanosomes involved in their generation have been limited. A
    data set sampling variables of extant avian melanosomes reveals that those
    forming most iridescent arrays are distinctly narrow. Quantitative
    comparison of these data with melanosome imprints densely sampled from a
    previously unknown specimen of the Early Cretaceous feathered
    \emph{Microraptor} predicts that its plumage was predominantly iridescent.
    The capacity for simple iridescent arrays is thus minimally inferred in
    paravian dinosaurs. This finding and estimation of \emph{Microraptor}
    feathering consistent with an ornamental function for the tail suggest a
    centrality for signaling in early evolution of plumage and feather color.}

      has the ambition to be a global standard for IT-security certification.
      The issued certifications are mutually recognized between the signatories
      of the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement. The key element of mutual
      relationships is trust. A question raised in this paper is how far trust
      can be maintained in Common Criteria when additional signatories enter
      with conflicting geopolitical interests to earlier signatories. Other
      issues raised are control over production, the lack of permanent
      organization in the Common Criteria, which leads to concerns of being
      able to oversee the actual compliance. As Common Criteria is formulated
      today it is unlikely that it would survive over time. The reasons why it
      might fail is the rigid framework, rapid technical development makes a
      security target a moving target leading to instability and uncertainty,
      and the increased militarization in cyberspace moving from information
      assurance to information operations.},

    discovered measurement of information and the well-known physics concept of
    entropy were described by the same equations. It takes $kT\log2$ joules of
    energy to flip a bit; it cannot be done in less than $h\over 4E$ seconds,
    where $E$ is the energy we're willing to spend on the bit flip. To
    brute-force a 128 bit key requires destroying about 64 bits of information
    per round; if it were otherwise, clever cryptographers would frustrate
    brute-forcers by choosing keys near the upper end of the range. Conclusion:
    it takes $10^{17}$ joules to brute-force a 128-bit key, equivalent to a
    hundred 1 megatonne nuclear bombs. Doing it with that little power would
    take $10^{16}$ seconds, or about a billion years. NSA cannot be

    observed on the World Wide Web and collected by Google, Inc. in 2006, the
    CLOAK system automatically flags candidate words, phrases, sentences, and
    paragraphs in documents under review that are likely classified and
    suggests redactions to make the document unclassified. Security
    classification guidance from more than one guide at a time is figured into
    each suggested redaction. The probabilistic aspect of operation is in the
    way the system prioritizes its suggestions according to the measured rate
    of occurrence of words and phrases observed in the language's current
    usage, avoiding low likelihood phrases in favor of more probable
    interpretations. Collocation correlation of phrases in security
    classification guides has automatically discovered missing, incomplete, and
    inconsistent rules in existing security classification guides, promoting
    forward quality improvement of security classification guides. Performance
    from the earliest prototype software, implemented in Perl using associative
    arrays, was surprisingly acceptable and suggests that an alternative
    network representation, to be implemented using the map-reduce algorithm on
    a high performance cluster, would have improved capacity, depth, accuracy,

	abstract = {Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) is one of the
    important topics in cryptography. It aims to address a practical security
    problem: how to establish secure communication between two parties solely
    based on a shared password without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI). After more than a decade of extensive research in this field, there
    have been several PAKE protocols available. The EKE and SPEKE schemes are
    perhaps the two most notable examples. Both techniques are however
    patented. In this paper, we review these techniques in detail and summarize
    various theoretical and practical weaknesses. In addition, we present a new
    PAKE solution called J-PAKE. Our strategy is to depend on well-established
    primitives such as the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). So far, almost all of
    the past solutions have avoided using ZKP for the concern on efficiency. We
    demonstrate how to effectively integrate the ZKP into the protocol design
    and meanwhile achieve good efficiency. Our protocol has comparable
    computational efficiency to the EKE and SPEKE schemes with clear advantages
    on security.},

    unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future. It first outlines what
    would constitute cyber war: a potentially lethal, instrumental, and

    shows what cyber war is not, case-by-case. Not one single cyber offense on
    record constitutes an act of war on its own. The final part offers a more
    nuanced terminology to come to terms with cyber attacks. All politically
    motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of three

	abstract = {Computing systems often deliberately release (or declassify)
    sensitive information. A principal security concern for systems permitting
    information release is whether this release is safe: is it possible that
    the attacker compromises the information release mechanism and extracts
    more secret information than intended? While the security community has
    recognised the importance of the problem, the state-of-the-art in
    information release is, unfortunately, a number of approaches with somewhat
    unconnected semantic goals. We provide a road map of the main directions of
    current research, by classifying the basic goals according to what
    information is released, who releases information, where in the system
    information is released and when information can be released. With a
    general declassification framework as a long-term goal, we identify some
    prudent principles of declassification. These principles shed light on
    existing definitions and may also serve as useful `sanity checks' for
    emerging models.},

    to resolve type errors in security-typed programs, enabling legacy code to
    be retrofit with comprehensive security policy mediation. Resolving such
    type errors requires selecting a placement of \emph{mediation statements}
    that implement runtime security decisions, such as declassifiers and
    authorization checks. Manually placing mediation statements in legacy code
    can be difficult, as there may be several, interacting type errors. In this
    paper, we solve this problem by constructing a graph that has the property
    that a vertex cut is equivalent to the points at which mediation statements
    can be inserted to allow the program to satisfy the type system. We build a
    framework that produces \emph{suggestions} that are minimum cuts of this
    graph, and the framework can be customized to find suggestions that satisfy
    programmer requirements. Our framework implementation for Java programs
    computes suggestions for 20,000 line programs in less than 100 seconds,
    reduces the number of locations a programmer must consider by 90\%, and
    selects suggestions similar to those proposed by expert programmers 80\% of
    the time.},

	abstract = {Three hypotheses have attempted to explain the phenomenon of
    contagious yawning. It has been hypothesized that it is a fixed action
    pattern for which the releasing stimulus is the observation of another
    yawn, that it is the result of non-conscious mimicry emerging through close
    links between perception and action or that it is the result of empathy,
    involving the ability to engage in mental state attribution. This set of
    experiments sought to distinguish between these hypotheses by examining
    contagious yawning in a species that is unlikely to show nonconscious
    mimicry and empathy but does respond to social stimuli: the red-footed
    tortoise Geochelone carbonaria. A demonstrator tortoise was conditioned to
    yawn when presented with a red square-shaped stimulus. Observer tortoises
    were exposed to three conditions: observation of conditioned yawn, non
    demonstration control, and stimulus only control. We measured the number of
    yawns for each observer animal in each condition. There was no difference
    between conditions. Experiment 2 therefore increased the number of
    conditioned yawns presented. Again, there was no significant difference
    between conditions. It seemed plausible that the tortoises did not view the
    conditioned yawn as a real yawn and therefore a final experiment was run
    using video recorded stimuli. The observer tortoises were presented with
    three conditions: real yawn, conditioned yawns and empty background. Again
    there was no significant difference between conditions. We therefore
    conclude that the red-footed tortoise does not yawn in response to
    observing a conspecific yawn. This suggests that contagious yawning is not
    the result of a fixed action pattern but may involve more complex social
    processes},

    are conservative in design for an operating depth of 6000 feet. The use of
    a test window seat which does not simulate the hull strains is satisfactory
    for window test. It is recommended that the conical window seat be extended
    inward beyond the window to allow for normal elastic extrusion. Plexiglas
    windows are susceptible to collision damage due to brittleness and low
    strength of the material. An external rubber gasket was required to prevent

    \ldots Lesson 9. The biggest lesson to be learned from this project was
    hard. Before we completed product certification, management cut off our
    funding. Their justification for this surprise was that there was no market
    for our product. \ldots The key lesson learned was to always make senior
    management part of the development team, so that their commitment to the

		analogue of aerodynamic lift, in which a cambered
		refractive object with differently shaped top and
		bottom surfaces experiences a transverse lift force
		when placed in a uniform stream of light. A
		semi-cylindrical rod is found to automatically
		torque into a stable angle of attack, and then
		exhibit uniform motion. We have experimentally
		verified this using a micrometer-scale lightfoil
		which was fabricated using photolithographic
		techniques, immersed in water and illuminated with
		milliwatt-scale laser light. Unlike optical tweezers,
		an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a
		transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted
		simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of
		light. We propose using optical lift to power
		micromachines, transport microscopic particles in
		a liquid, or to improve the design of solar sails
		for interstellar space travel.

		in recent years. Moreover, smartphones are often used
		for privacy-sensitive tasks, becoming highly valuable
		targets for attackers. They are also quite different
		from PCs, so that PC-oriented solutions are not always
		applicable, or do not offer comprehensive security. We
		propose an alternative solution, where security checks
		are applied on remote \emph{security servers} that
		host exact \emph{replicas} of the phones in virtual
		environments. The servers are not subject to the
		same constraints, allowing us to apply \emph{multiple}
		detection techniques \emph{simultaneously}. We implemented
		a prototype of this security model for Android phones, and
		show that it is both practical and scalable: we generate
		no more than 2KiB/s and 64B/s of trace data for high-loads
		and idle operation respectively, and are able to support
		more than a hundred replicas running on a single server.

		necessarily inform the design of usability, and vice-versa.
		One way of using scenarios to bridge security and usability
		involves explicitly describing how design decisions can lead
		to users inadvertently exploiting vulnerabilities to carry out
		their production tasks. This paper presents Mis-usability
		Cases: scenarios which describe how design decisions may lead
		to usability problems subsequently leading to system misuse.
		We describe the related work motivating the design of the
		Mis-usability Cases before presenting the approach, and
		illustrating its application using a case study example.
		Finally, we describe some findings from this approach, which
		further inform the design of usable and secure systems.},

	abstract = {Side channel attacks on cryptographic systems are
		attacks exploiting information gained from physical
		implementations rather than utilizing theoretical
		weaknesses of a scheme. In particular, during the last
		years, major achievements were made for the class of
		access-driven cache-attacks. The source of information
		leakage for such attacks are the locations of memory
		accesses performed by a victim process.

		In this paper we analyze the case of AES and present an
		attack which is capable of recovering the full secret key
		in almost realtime for AES-128, requiring only a very
		limited number of observed encryptions. Unlike most other
		attacks, ours neither needs to know the ciphertext, nor
		does it need to know any information about the plaintext
		(such as its distribution, etc.). Moreover, for the first
		time we also show how the plaintext can be recovered
		without having access to the ciphertext. Further, our
		spy process can be run under an unprivileged user account.
		It is the first working attack for implementations using
		compressed tables, where it is not possible to find
		out the beginning of AES rounds any more -- a corner
		stone for all efficient previous attacks. All results
		of our attack have been demonstrated by a fully working
		implementation, and do not solely rely on theoretical
		considerations or simulations.

		A contribution of probably independent interest is a denial
		of service attack on the scheduler of current Linux
		systems (CFS), which allows to monitor memory accesses
		with novelly high precision. Finally, we give some
		generalizations of our attack, and suggest some possible
		countermeasures which would render our attack impossible.

		encountered in the HPLC or GC measurements of such ratios when these
		measurements are conducted without accurate calibrations or determinations
		of response factors for the particular isomers. Accurately defined
		mixtures of compounds (prepared by volumetric means) were examined
		by the above methods and the obtained measurements compared with the
		actual composition. The relative errors between actual content and the
		measured values are listed for all comparisons. In addition, accuracy
		in the determination of weight of a sample as a function of scale was
		also examined. The results are tabulated for comparison and suggestions
		are made to the reader as to how to avoid inaccurate reporting of
		experimental parameters. The authors hope that disclosure of these facts
		will result in new editorial policies requiring that a phrase dr or er
		ratios reported in this paper have not been validated by calibration'
		be inserted into general experimental descriptions. In addition, such
		editorial policy should also discourage the use of terms de' and ee',
		as these descriptors do not provide accurate and meaningful information
		about stereoisomer composition. This latter issue has already been
		suggested in the literature on several occasions.},

    complicate the certification test and evaluation problem, because along

    interpreted as conflating the principle of defence-in-depth with the

    for accreditors, this research aims to reduce time and cost wasted on
    unnecessary retesting of the same or similar security requirements during

		We conclude that trust is a dangerous word to use as it has
		manifold and sometimes contradictory meanings. There is no
		immediate problem when trust is used in a specific research area
		to denote some concept of interest. Difficulties arise when
		interfacing between communities that use this word differently,
		and with the general public which is unlikely to associate a word
		like trust with any specific technical definition adopted in a
		field of research.

	abstract = {A previously unknown form of compromising emanations has
        been discovered. LED status indicators on data communication
        equipment, under certain conditions, are shown to carry a modulated
        optical signal that is significantly correlated with information
        being processed by the device. Physical access is not required; the
        attacker gains access to all data going through the device, including
        plaintext in the case of data encryption systems. Experiments show
        that it is possible to intercept data under realistic conditions at
        a considerable distance. Many different sorts of devices, including
        modems and Internet Protocol routers, were found to be vulnerable. A
        taxonomy of compromising optical emanations is developed, and design
        changes are described that will successfully block this kind of
        ``Optical Tempest'' attack.},
