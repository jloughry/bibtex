  abstract = {An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT for short) can be defined as a
    targeted and very sophisticated cyber attack. IT administrators need tools
    that allow early detection of these attacks. Several approaches have been
    proposed to provide solutions to this problem based on the attack life
    cycle. Recently, machine learning techniques have been implemented in these
    approaches to improve the problem of detection. This paper aims to propose
    a new approach to APT detection, using machine learning techniques, and
    based on the life cycle of an APT attack. The proposed model is organised
    in two passive stages and three active stages to adapt the mitigation
    techniques based on machine learning.},

  abstract = {It is known that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped
    computers through their speakers via sonic and ultrasonic waves. To
    eliminate the threat of such acoustic covert channels in sensitive systems,
    audio hardware can be disabled and the use of loudspeakers can be strictly
    forbidden. Such audio-less systems are considered to be
    \textit{audio-gapped}, and hence immune to acoustic covert channels. In
    this paper, we introduce a technique that enable attackers leak data
    acoustically from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems. Our developed
    malware can exploit the computer power supply unit (PSU) to play sounds and
    use it as an out-of-band, secondary speaker with limited capabilities. The
    malicious code manipulates the internal \textit{switching frequency} of the
    power supply and hence controls the sound waveforms generated from its
    capacitors and transformers. Our technique enables producing audio tones in
    a frequency band of 0-24khz and playing audio streams (e.g., WAV) from a
    computer power supply without the need for audio hardware or speakers.
    Binary data (files, keylogging, encryption keys, etc.) can be modulated
    over the acoustic signals and sent to a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone).
    We show that our technique works with various types of systems: PC
    workstations and servers, as well as embedded systems and IoT devices that
    have no audio hardware at all. We provide technical background and discuss
    implementation details such as signal generation and data modulation. We
    show that the POWER-SUPPLaY code can operate from an ordinary user-mode
    process and doesn't need any hardware access or special privileges. Our
    evaluation shows that using POWER-SUPPLaY, sensitive data can be
    exfiltrated from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems from a distance of
    five meters away at a maximal bit rates of 50 bit/sec.},

    Computers via Covert Hard Drive Noise},
  year = 2016,
  month = {August},
  abstract = {Air-gapped computers are disconnected from the Internet
    physically and logically. This measure is taken in order to prevent the
    leakage of sensitive data from secured networks. In the past, it has been
    shown that malware can exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers by
    transmitting ultrasonic signals via the computer's speakers. However, such
    acoustic communication relies on the availability of speakers on a
    computer. In this paper, we present `DiskFiltration,' a covert channel
    which facilitates the leakage of data from an air-gapped compute via
    acoustic signals emitted from its hard disk drive (HDD). Our method is
    unique in that, unlike other acoustic covert channels, it doesn't require
    the presence of speakers or audio hardware in the air-gapped computer. A
    malware installed on a compromised machine can generate acoustic emissions
    at specific audio frequencies by controlling the movements of the HDD's
    actuator arm. Digital Information can be modulated over the acoustic
    signals and then be picked up by a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone,
    smartwatch, laptop, etc.). We examine the HDD anatomy and analyze its
    acoustical characteristics. We also present signal generation and
    detection, and data modulation and demodulation algorithms. Based on our
    proposed method, we developed a transmitter on a personal computer and a
    receiver on a smartphone, and we provide the design and implementation
    details. We also evaluate our covert channel on various types of internal
    and external HDDs in different computer chassis and at various distances.
    With DiskFiltration we were able to covertly transmit data (e.g.,
    passwords, encryption keys, and keylogging data) between air-gapped
    computers to a smartphone at an effective bit rate of 180 bits/minute
    (10,800 bits/hour) and a distance of up to two meters (six feet).},

  abstract = {Neanderthals are often considered as less technologically
    advanced than modern humans. However, we typically only find faunal remains
    or stone tools at Paleolithic sites. Perishable materials, comprising the
    vast majority of material culture items, are typically missing. Individual
    twisted fibres on stone tools from the Abri du Maras led to the hypothesis
    of Neanderthal string production in the past, but conclusive evidence was
    lacking. Here we show direct evidence of fibre technology in the form of a
    3-ply cord fragment made from inner bark fibres on a stone tool recovered
    in situ from the same site. Twisted fibres provide the basis for clothing,
    rope, bags, nets, mats, boats, etc. which, once discovered, would have
    become an indispensable part of daily life. Understanding and use of
    twisted fibres implies the use of complex multi-component technology as
    well as a mathematical understanding of pairs, sets, and numbers. Added to
    recent evidence of birch bark tar, art, and shell beads, the idea that
    Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to modern humans is becoming
    increasingly untenable.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that the integrity of sensor
    measurements can be violated through out-of-band signal injection attacks.
    These attacks target the conversion process from a physical quantity to an
    analog property---a process that fundamentally cannot be authenticated.
    Out-of-band signal injection attacks thus pose previously-unexplored
    security risks by exploiting hardware imperfections in the sensors
    themselves, or in their interfaces to microcontrollers. In response to the
    growing-yet-disjointed literature in the subject, this article presents the
    first survey of out-of-band signal injection attacks. It focuses on
    unifying their terminology and identifying commonalities in their causes
    and effects through a chronological, evolutionary, and thematic taxonomy of
    attacks. By highlighting cross-influences between different types of
    out-of-band signal injections, this paper underscores the need for a common
    language irrespective of the attack method. By placing attack and defense
    mechanisms in the wider context of their dual counterparts of side-channel
    leakage and electromagnetic interference, this study identifies common
    threads and gaps that can help guide and inform future research. Overall,
    the ever-increasing reliance on sensors embedded in everyday commodity
    devices necessitates that a stronger focus be placed on improving the
    security of such systems against out-of-band signal injection attacks.},

    concern. Real-time THS off-gassing from smokers into a nonsmoking movie
    theater was observed with online and offline high-resolution mass
    spectrometry. Prominent emission events of THS tracers (e.g.,
    2,5-dimethylfuran, 2-methylfuran, and acetonitrile) and other
    tobacco-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs) coincided with the
    arrival of certain moviegoers and left residual contamination. These VOC
    emission events exposed occupants to the equivalent of 1 to 10 cigarettes
    of secondhand smoke, including multiple hazardous air pollutants (e.g.,
    benzene and formaldehyde) at parts-per-billion concentrations. Nicotine and
    related intermediate-volatility nitrogen-containing compounds, which
    vaporized from clothes/bodies and recondensed onto aerosol, comprised 34\%
    of observed functionalized organic aerosol abundance. Exposure to THS VOC
    emission events will be considerably enhanced in poorly ventilated or
    smaller spaces in contrast with a large, well-ventilated theaterâamplifying
    concentrations and potential impacts on health and indoor chemistry.},

  abstract = {Quantum scrambling is the dispersal of local information into
    many-body quantum entanglements and correlations distributed throughout an
    entire system. This concept accompanies the dynamics of thermalization in
    closed quantum systems, and has recently emerged as a powerful tool for
    characterizing chaos in black holes. However, the direct experimental
    measurement of quantum scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential
    complexity of ergodic many-body entangled states. One way to characterize
    quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation
    function (OTOC); however, because scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do
    not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary
    decoherence. Here we implement a quantum circuit that provides a positive
    test for the scrambling features of a given unitary process. This
    approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through the circuit,
    providing an unambiguous test for whether scrambling has occurred, while
    simultaneously measuring an OTOC. We engineer quantum scrambling processes
    through a tunable three-qubit unitary operation as part of a seven-qubit
    circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured teleportation fidelities
    are typically about 80 per cent, and enable us to experimentally bound the
    scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC measurement.},

  abstract = {Many college students intend to pursue science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) careers but quickly abandon these goals when
    confronted with notoriously competitive STEM courses that often pit
    students against each other. This emphasis on interpersonal competition
    could be especially detrimental for first-generation (FG) college students,
    an underrepresented group in STEM fields which more strongly values
    communality and collaboration relative to their continuing-generation
    peers. Thus, FG students may experience more imposter feelings in STEM
    courses perceived as having a competitive culture. A longitudinal study
    (with 818 students and 2,638 experience-sampling observations) found that
    perceived classroom competition was associated with greater daily in-class
    imposter feelings among all students---but especially among FG students.
    Imposter feelings in turn predicted students' end-of-term course
    engagement, attendance, dropout intentions, and course grades. Classroom
    competition and the imposter feelings it engenders may be an overlooked
    barrier for promoting the engagement, performance, and retention of FG
    students in STEM.},

    in the 1990s, inclusive of the scholarship of discovery, integration,
    teaching, and application, the School of Nursing and Jewish Geriatric
    Services, Inc., have instituted a unique collaboration entitled the Scholar
    in Residence. Unlike traditional agreements between schools of nursing and
    agencies to provide clinical experience and educate students, this
    agreement is designed to build scholarship for both university and agency.
    Outcomes include building opportunities for faculty and staff scholarship
    at the agency, enhancing the integration of knowledge into practice,
    intensifying opportunities for the sharing of knowledge by providing
    opportunities for students to work with faculty and staff on individual
    projects, and enriching the application of knowledge by providing
    opportunities for faculty clinical practice and consultation. The Scholar
    in Residence is a model of collaboration between the university and the
    community that reflects the mission of the university and provides value to
    the community agency through strategic engagement of both entities.},

    in the affirmative. For several years, I have been engaged in study of the
    NASA-JPL photographs transmitted to Earth from the surface vehicles sent to
    explore Mars, Curiosity Rover in particular. These photos are available to
    the public via the internet. In this poster, I present and discuss numerous
    examples of insect/arthropod-like forms (fossil \& living) found in Mars
    rover photos. Examples include insect-like forms displaying apparent
    diversity, clearly recognizable insect/arthropod anatomical features, and
    flight. Evidence of a fossil reptile-like (serpentine) form and
    reptile-like forms preying on insect-like forms is also presented. Each
    example is documented. These findings provide a compelling basis for
    further study and raise many important questions.},

  abstract = {We show \ce{H2O2} is spontaneously produced from pure water by
    atomizing bulk water into microdroplets (1 \textmu m to 20 \textmu m in
    diameter). Production of \ce{H2O2}, as assayed by \ce{H2O2}-sensitve
    fluorescence dye peroxyfluor-1, increased with decreasing microdroplet
    size. Cleavage of 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid and conversion of
    phenylboronic acid to phenols in microdroplets further confirmed the
    generation of \ce{H2O2}. The generated \ce{H2O2} concentration was
    $\sim 30$ \textmu M ($\sim 1$ part per million) as determined by titration
    with potassium titanium oxalate. Changing the spray gas to \ce{O2} or
    bubbling \ce{O2} decreased the yield of \ce{H2O2} in microdroplets,
    indicating that pure water microdroplets directly generate \ce{H2O2}
    without help from \ce{O2} either in air surrounding the droplet or
    dissolved in water. We consider various possible mechanisms for \ce{H2O2}
    formation and report a number of different experiments exploring this
    issue. We suggest that hydroxyl radical (\ce{OH}) recombination is the most
    likely source, in which \ce{OH} is generated by loss of an electron from
    \ce{OH-} at or near the surface of the water microdroplet. This
    catalyst-free and voltage-free \ce{H2O2} production method provides
    innovative opportunities for green production of hydrogen peroxide.},

  abstract = {Ocean plastic can persist in sea surface waters, eventually
  accumulating in remote areas of the world's oceans. Here we characterise and
  quantify a major ocean plastic accumulation zone formed in subtropical waters
  between California and Hawaii: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). Our
  model, calibrated with data from multi-vessel and aircraft surveys, predicted
  at least 79 (45--129) thousand tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an
  area of 1.6 million km\textsuperscript{2}; a figure four to sixteen times
  higher than previously reported. We explain this difference through the use
  of more robust methods to quantify larger debris. Over three-quarters of the
  GPGP mass was carried by debris larger than 5âcm and at least 46\% was
  comprised of fishing nets. Microplastics accounted for 8\% of the total mass
  but 94\% of the estimated 1.8 (1.1--3.6) trillion pieces floating in the
  area. Plastic collected during our study has specific characteristics such as
  small surface-to-volume ratio, indicating that only certain types of debris
  have the capacity to persist and accumulate at the surface of the GPGP.
  Finally, our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is
  increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.},

  abstract = {In face perception, besides physiognomic changes, accessories
    like eyeglasses can influence facial appearance. According to a stereotype,
    people who wear glasses are more intelligent, but less attractive. In a
    series of four experiments, we showed how full-rim and rimless glasses,
    differing with respect to the amount of face they cover, affect face
    perception, recognition, distinctiveness, and the attribution of
    stereotypes. Eyeglasses generally directed observers' gaze to the eye
    regions; rimless glasses made faces appear less distinctive and resulted in
    reduced distinctiveness in matching and in recognition tasks. Moreover, the
    stereotype was confirmed but depended on the kind of glasses---rimless
    glasses yielded an increase in perceived trustworthiness, but not a
    decrease in attractiveness. Thus, glasses affect how we perceive the faces
    of the people wearing them and, in accordance with an old stereotype, they
    can lower how attractive, but increase how intelligent and trustworthy
    people wearing them appear. These effects depend on the kind of glasses
    worn.},

    its original form but images from the experimental situation kept
    interfering. Concluded that the visual system is a relatively stable
    structure, however adjustment is required. The inverted position of the
    retinal image is not essential to upright vision as it does not contribute
    towards harmony between touch and sight. Direction of movement is not
    judged on purely muscular evidence but on subjective experience and

  abstract = {We present the development, integration and performance of a next
    generation attitude sensor suite for the GPS IIIF satellite attitude
    control system (ACS), which improves payload user range error (URE) and
    link margin while significantly reducing cost. Honeywell and Lockheed
    Martin partnered to develop and qualify the new Stellar Attitude and Rate
    Measurement Unit (STARMU), which will be flown on multiple National
    Security Space (NSS) missions including GPS IIIF. We present flight data
    from the first STARMU flight on a commercial GEO spacecraft in early 2019.
    As the hardware supplier, Honeywell has integrated two flight proven,
    autonomous Active Pixel Sensor (APS)-based star trackers from Sodern with a
    redundant electronics unit that includes a processor, two sets of
    three-axis accelerometers and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
    gyros. We describe the STARMU design and qualification for GPS IIIF mission
    requirements, including natural and nuclear threat radiation environments,
    and provide expected sensor performance to demonstrate enhanced GPS IIIF
    space vehicle attitude determination and control accuracy with the STARMU
    compared to the current GPS III earth and sun sensor-based ACS. Using
    continuous three-axis star tracker data as the primary attitude and
    attitude rate measurements, the system improves antenna pointing accuracy
    by $8\%$ in the nadir direction and $>50\%$ in rotation about nadir, with
    corresponding improvements to navigation and hosted payload performance. A
    backup attitude determination system that utilizes the STARMU MEMS gyros
    and a coarse sun sensor during early orbit and safe mode operations is also
    described.},

    $n$-bit {RSA} with $n/2$ Qubits},
  author = {Alexander May and Lars Schlieper},
  year = 2019,
  month = {24 May},
  abstract = {We study quantum period finding algorithms such as Simon, Shor,
    and Eker{\aa}-H{\aa}stad. For a periodic function $f$ these algorithms
    produce---via some quantum embedding of $f$---a quantum superposition
    $\sum_x\Ket{x}\Ket{f(x)}$,
    which requires a certain amount of output bits that represent
    $\Ket{f(x)}$. We show that we can lower this amount to a single output
    qubit by hashing $f$ down to a single bit. Namely, we replace the embedding
    of $f$ in quantum period finding circuits by several embeddings of hashed
    versions of $f$. We show that on expectation this modification only doubles
    the required amount of quantum measurements, while significantly reducing
    the total number of qubits. For example, for Simon's period finding
    algorithm in some $n$-bit function
    $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_2^n$ our hashing technique reduces
    the required qubits from $2n$ down to $n+1$. For the Eker\aa-H\aa stad
    algorithm for factoring $n$-bit RSA our hashing reduces the required qubits
    from $({3\over 2}+o(1))n$ down to $({1\over 2}+o(1))n$.},

  abstract = {General cognitive function is a prominent and relatively stable
    human trait that is associated with many important life outcomes. We
    combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia,
    and UK Biobank (total $Nâ=â300,486$; age 16--102) and find 148 genome-wide
    significant independent loci ($Pâ<â5âÃâ10^{-8}$) associated with general
    cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated
    with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and
    psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709
    genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across
    the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic
    scores, up to 4.3\% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted
    in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between
    general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables
    including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify
    novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general
    cognitive function.},

    consumes a significant fraction of resources for these workloads. We
    propose to decrease this overhead by moving GC into a small hardware
    accelerator that is located close to the memory controller and performs GC
    more efficiently than a CPU. We first show a general design of such a GC
    accelerator and describe how it can be integrated into both stop-the-world
    and pause-free garbage collectors. We then demonstrate an end-to-end RTL
    prototype, integrated into a RocketChip RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)
    executing full Java benchmarks within JikesRVM running under Linux on
    FPGAs. Our prototype performs the mark phase of a tracing GC at $4.2\times$
    the performance of an in-order CPU, at just 18.5\% the area. By prototyping
    our design in a real system, we show that our accelerator can be adopted
    without invasive changes to the SoC, and estimate its performance, area,
    and energy.},

  these cases, do firms promote the best potential manager or the best worker
  in her current job? Using microdata on the performance of sales workers at
  214 firms, we find evidence consistent with the ``Peter Principle,'' which
  predicts that firms prioritize current job performance in promotion decisions
  at the expense of other observable characteristics that better predict
  managerial performance.  We estimate that the costs of promoting workers with
  lower managerial potential are high, suggesting either that firms are making
  inefficient promotion decisions or that  the benefits of promotion-based
  incentives are great enough to justify the costs of managerial mismatch.},

  abstract = {Photonic cooling of matter has enabled both access to unexplored
    states of matter, such as Bose--Einstein condensates, and novel approaches
    to solid-state refrigeration. Critical to these photonic cooling approaches
    is the use of low-entropy coherent radiation from lasers, which makes the
    cooling process thermodynamically feasible. Recent theoretical work has
    suggested that photonic solid-state cooling may be accomplished by tuning
    the chemical potential of photons without using coherent laser radiation,
    but such cooling has not been experimentally realized. Here we report an
    experimental demonstration of photonic cooling without laser light using a
    custom-fabricated nanocalorimetric device and a photodiode. We show that
    when they are in each other's near-field---that is, when the size of the
    vacuum gap between the planar surfaces of the calorimetric device and a
    reverse-biased photodiode is reduced to tens of nanometres---solid-state
    cooling of the calorimetric device can be accomplished via a combination of
    photon tunnelling, which enhances the transport of photons across nanoscale
    gaps, and suppression of photon emission from the photodiode due to a
    change in the chemical potential of the photons under an applied reverse
    bias. This demonstration of active nanophotonic cooling---without the use
    of coherent laser radiation---lays the experimental foundation for
    systematic exploration of nanoscale photonics and optoelectronics for
    solid-state refrigeration and on-chip device cooling.},

  abstract = {As a copious source of gamma-rays, a nearby Galactic Gamma-Ray
    Burst (GRB) can be a threat to life. Using recent determinations of the
    rate of GRBs, their luminosity function and properties of their host
    galaxies, we estimate the probability that a life-threatening (lethal)
    GRB would take place. Amongst the different kinds of GRBs, long ones are
    most dangerous. There is a very good chance (but no certainty) that at
    least one lethal GRB took place during the past 5 Gyr close enough to
    Earth as to significantly damage life. There is a 50\% chance that such a
    lethal GRB took place during the last 500 Myr causing one of the major
    mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of radiation would
    be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore the
    potential effects of GRBs to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the
    Universe. We find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much larger in
    the inner Milky Way (95\% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic
    center), making it inhospitable to life. Only at the outskirts of the
    Milky Way, at more than 10 kpc from the galactic center, this probability
    drops below 50\%. When considering the Universe as a whole, the safest
    environments for life (similar to the one on Earth) are the lowest
    density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies and life can exist in
    only $\approx 10\%$ of galaxies. Remarkably, a cosmological constant is
    essential for such systems to exist. Furthermore, because of both the
    higher GRB rate and galaxies being smaller, life as it exists on Earth
    could not take place at $z > 0.5$. Early life forms must have been much
    more resilient to radiation.},

    crime using Facebook data. We study the case of Germany, where the
    recently emerged right-wing party {\it Alternative f\"{u}r Deutschland}
    (AfD) has developed a major social media presence. We show that
    right-wing anti-refugee sentiment on Facebook predicts violent crimes
    against refugees in otherwise similar municipalities with higher social
    media usage. To further establish causality, we exploit exogenous
    variation in major internet and Facebook outages, which fully undo the
    correlation between social media and hate crime. We further find that the
    effect decreases with distracting news events; increases with user
    network interactions; and does not hold for posts unrelated to refugees.
    Our results suggest that social media can act as a propagation mechanism
    between online hate speech and real-life violent crime.},

  abstract = {The recently discovered S1 stream passes through the Solar
    neighborhood on a low inclination, counterrotating orbit. The progenitor
    of S1 is a dwarf galaxy with a total mass comparable to the present-day
    Fornax dwarf spheroidal, so the stream is expected to have a significant
    DM component. We compute the effects of the S1 stream on WIMP and axion
    detectors as a function of the density of its unmeasured dark component.
    In WIMP detectors the S1 stream supplies more high energy nuclear recoils
    so will marginally improve DM detection prospects. We find that even if
    S1 comprises less than 10\% of the local density, multiton xenon WIMP
    detectors can distinguish the S1 stream from the bulk halo in the
    relatively narrow mass range between 5 and 25 GeV. In directional WIMP
    detectors such as CYGNUS, S1 increases DM detection prospects more
    substantially since it enhances the anisotropy of the WIMP signal.
    Finally, we show that axion haloscopes possess by far the greatest
    potential sensitivity to the S1 stream if its dark matter component is
    sufficiently cold. Once the axion mass has been discovered, the
    distinctive velocity distribution of S1 can easily be extracted from the
    axion power spectrum.},

    We examined how people justified their agreement with statements

    vaccinations. Participants rated their level of agreement with statements
    reflecting the scientific consensus on these topics, then responded to
    open-ended questions asking them to justify their position and to
    generate challenges to their belief. Responses to individual difference
    measures allowed us to assess the relationship between participants'
    positions on these scientific issues and cognitive style, conspiracy
    ideation, religious service attendance, and political ideology.
    Qualitative analyses revealed inconsistent and topic-specific patterns of
    reasoning. Additionally, greater agreement with scientific conclusions
    was related to a greater predisposition towards analytical thinking and
    stronger self-reported political liberalism. These findings provide a
    next step for better understanding why some individuals reject science

  abstract = {Enforcing security in Internet of Things environments has been
    identified as one of the top barriers for realizing the vision of smart,
    energy-efficient homes and buildings. In this context, understanding the
    risks related to the use and potential misuse of information about homes,
    partners, and end-users, as well as, forming methods for integrating
    security-enhancing measures in the design is not straightforward and thus
    requires substantial investigation. A risk analysis applied on a smart
    home automation system developed in a research project involving leading
    industrial actors has been conducted. Out of 32 examined risks, 9 were
    classified as low and 4 as high, i.e., most of the identified risks were
    deemed as moderate. The risks classified as high were either related to
    the human factor or to the software components of the system. The results
    indicate that with the implementation of standard security features, new,
    as well as, current risks can be minimized to acceptable levels albeit
    that the most serious risks, i.e., those derived from the human factor,
    need more careful consideration, as they are inherently complex to
    handle. A discussion of the implications of the risk analysis results
    points to the need for a more general model of security and privacy
    included in the design phase of smart homes. With such a model of
    security and privacy in design in place, it will contribute to enforcing
    system security and enhancing user privacy in smart homes, and thus
    helping to further realize the potential in such IoT environments.},

  abstract = {Data hiding usually involves the alteration of a cover signal
    for embedding a secret message. In this paper, we propose a construction
    based data hiding technique which transforms a secret message into a
    fingerprint image directly. Unlike the conventional data hiding
    techniques, this scheme does not need any cover signals to participate.
    Instead, it generates the fingerprint image based on a piece of hologram
    phase constructed from the secret message. The hologram phase consists of
    the spiral phase and the continuous phase. Firstly, we propose to map the
    secret message to a polynomial and encode it into a set of points with
    different polarities, from which the spiral phase is computed and
    constructed. Then, we construct the continuous phase by decomposing a
    fingerprint image synthetically generated. The spiral phase and the
    continuous phase are combined to form the hologram phase. This is
    eventually used to construct a fingerprint image in a common form such as
    a grayscale fingerprint image, a binary fingerprint image, or a thinned
    fingerprint image. The secret message can be extracted by detecting the
    encoded points in the constructed fingerprint. We conduct the experiments
    by constructing fingerprint images with ordinary sizes, the results show
    that the secret message can be extracted accurately. It is also difficult
    to detect the existence of secret message from the constructed
    fingerprint images.},

    by an extraterrestrial intelligence using proven or near-term technology

    such lasers can produce a signal at ranges of less than 20,000 lt-yr,
    with a broad enough beam to overcome uncertainties in nearby exoplanet
    orbits (e.g., Prox Cen b) or encompass entire habitable zones of more
    distant systems (e.g., TRAPPIST-1). While the probability of closing a
    handshake with even a nearby extraterrestrial intelligence is low with
    current survey methodologies, advances in full-sky surveys for SETI and
    other purposes may reduce the mean-time-to-handshake to decades or
    centuries, after which these laser systems may close links at data rates
    of kbps--Mpbs. The next major gap to address for searching for
    extraterrestrial lasers is in expanding spectral searches into the
    infrared, where most terrestrial communication and high-power lasers are

    is examined. Examples are presented of clearly visible emissions from
    typical hydrogen flames. It is shown that while visible emissions from
    these flames are considerably weaker than those from comparable
    hydrocarbon flames, they are indeed visible, albeit at reduced light
    levels in most cases. Detailed flame spectra are presented to
    characterize flame emission bands in the ultraviolet, visible and
    infrared regions of the spectrum that result in a visible hydrogen flame.
    The visible blue emission is emphasized, and recorded spectra indicate
    that fine spectral structure is superimposed on a broadband continuum
    extending from the ultraviolet into the visible region. Tests were
    performed to show that this emission does not arise from carbon or
    nitrogen chemistry resulting from carbon-containing impurities
    (hydrocarbons) in the hydrogen fuel or from \ce{CO2} or \ce{N2}
    entrainment from the surrounding air. The spectral structure, however, is
    also observed in methane flames. The magnitude of the broadband emission
    increases with flame temperature in a highly nonlinear manner while the
    finer spectral structure is insensitive to temperature. A comparison of
    diffusion and premixed \ce{H2} flames shows that the fine scale structure
    is comparable in both flames.},

    subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{Z})$ provided $m>3$. The method
    utilizes many ingredients from our earlier proof of the conjecture for
    actions by cocompact lattices in $\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{R})$ but new
    ideas are needed to overcome the lack of compactness of the space
    $(G\times M)/\Gamma$ (admitting the induced $G$-action). Non-compactness
    allows both measures and Lyapunov exponents to escape to infinity under
    averaging and a number of algebraic, geometric, and dynamical tools are
    used control this escape. New ideas are provided by the work of Lubotzky,
    Mozes, and Raghunathan on the structure of nonuniform lattices and, in
    particular, of $\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb{Z})$ providing a geometric
    decomposition of the cusp into rank one directions, whose geometry is
    more easily controlled. The proof also makes use of a precise
    quantitative form of non-divergence of unipotent orbits by Kleinbock and
    Margulis, and an extension by de la Salle of strong property (T) to
    representations of nonuniform lattices.}

    water waves upon which a linear discrimination can be made. Whereas
    Wolfgang Maass' Liquid State Machine requires fine tuning of the spiking
    neural network parameters, water has inherent self-organising properties
    such as strong local interactions, time-dependent spread of activation to
    distant areas, inherent stability to a wide variety of inputs, and high
    complexity. Water achieves this ``for free'', and does so without the
    time-consuming computation required by realistic neural models. An
    analogy is made between water molecules and neurons in a recurrent neural
    network.},

    are not readily suitable for IoT devices, since they do not consider
    idiosyncrasies of a realistic large-scale IoT deployment. This motivates
    our design of ASSURED, a secure and scalable update framework for IoT.
    ASSURED includes all stakeholders in a typical IoT update ecosystem,
    while providing end-to-end security between manufacturers and devices. To
    demonstrate its feasibility and practicality, ASSURED is instantiated and
    experimentally evaluated on two commodity hardware platforms. Results
    show that ASSURED is considerably faster than current update mechanisms
    in realistic settings.},

    article theorises that forced connections happen when algorithms
    exacerbate human actions in connecting otherwise disparate data points on
    digitally networked platforms to the subject of the data's detriment.
    Although social media users may not have a comprehensive understanding of
    how algorithms work to make some content visible, when users form their
    own explanatory theories about these algorithms, they often intervene in
    these connections. Drawing on Michel de Certeau's notion of strategies as
    the manipulations in which platforms engage to profile and control their
    users, and tactics as everyday acts of resistance, this article
    investigates two tactics within algorithmic cultures---Voldemorting, or
    not mentioning words or names in order to avoid a forced connection; and
    screenshotting, or making content visible without sending its website
    traffic---to demonstrate users' understandings of the algorithms that
    seek to connect individuals to other people, platforms, content and
    advertisers, and their efforts to wrest back control.},

  abstract = {An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is a medical
    device used for the detection of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia and
    their treatment through the delivery of electrical shocks intended to
    restore normal heart rhythm. An ICD reprogramming attack seeks to alter
    the device's parameters to induce unnecessary shocks and, even more
    egregious, prevent required therapy. In this paper, we present a formal
    approach for the synthesis of ICD reprogramming attacks that are both
    effective, i.e., lead to fundamental changes in the required therapy, and
    stealthy, i.e., involve minimal changes to the nominal ICD parameters. We
    focus on the discrimination algorithm underlying Boston Scientific
    devices (one of the principal ICD manufacturers) and formulate the
    synthesis problem as one of multi-objective optimization. Our solution
    technique is based on an Optimization Modulo Theories encoding of the
    problem and allows us to derive device parameters that are optimal with
    respect to the effectiveness-stealthiness tradeoff (i.e., lie along the
    corresponding Pareto front). To the best of our knowledge, our work is
    the first to derive systematic ICD reprogramming attacks designed to
    maximize therapy disruption while minimizing detection. To evaluate our
    technique, we employ an extensive dataset of synthetic EGMs (cardiac
    signals), each generated with a prescribed arrhythmia, allowing us to
    synthesize attacks tailored to the victim's cardiac condition. Our
    approach readily generalizes to unseen signals, representing the unknown
    EGM of the victim patient.},

  title = {Novel suppression methods in fire protection},
  year = 2013,
  month = {December},
  school = {University of Texas at Austin},
  abstract = {The onset of fire within a compartment can pose a hazard to the
    occupants and the structure containing the compartment. Fire suppression
    systems aim to either extinguish or suppress an incipient fire before
    loss of life or damage to the structure can occur. The geometry and use
    of the compartment as well as the fuel packages within must be taken into
    account when choosing an appropriate fire suppression system. This thesis
    explores novel suppression methods inside of compartments. Los Alamos
    National Laboratories came to the University of Texas Fire Research Group
    (UTFRG) to characterize and investigate the fire danger inside of nuclear
    gloveboxes. The first suppression method discussed explores activation
    tests of a commercial automatic fire suppression system (Fire Foe
    [superscript TM]) containing heptaflouropropane (FE-36) fire suppressant
    conducted within a glovebox at the UTFRG's burn structure. Temperature
    and time to activation data of ten tests at four different fire sizes,
    three 13 kW, one 20 kW, three 25 kW, and three 50 kW, was taken. Gas
    temperatures from experiments were compared against NIST's Fire Dynamics
    Simulator (FDS) gas temperatures with good agreement. The time and
    spatially averaged net heat flux on a virtual Fire Foe [superscript TM]
    tube from the FDS simulations were passed to a thermo-physical,
    semi-empirical, sub-model to predict activation with poor agreement from
    experimental activation times. A Bayesian parameter inference was later
    run on the sub-model. While the Bayesian inference approach is able to
    match sub-model temperatures to experimental temperatures, some
    non-physical values for heat transfer coefficients and view factors were
    observed at the lower heat release rate fires. Micro combustion
    calorimetry (MCC) was used to determine heat of combustion of glovebox
    glove material and cone calorimetry tests were run to find ignition time
    versus incident heat flux. Using standard ignition time models, effective
    model parameters were calibrated. Thermal characterization of the glove
    material showed that the heat of combustion found from MCC was within the
    range of heats of combustion for other non-halogenated materials found in
    the literature. Analysis of the time to ignition tests showed that the
    glove material should be modeled as thermally thick when one would expect
    thin behavior. This behavior was attributed to possible heat losses from
    the back of the glove material. Dry water is expected to have similar
    suppression characteristics as water mist systems because the dry water
    particle sizes are on the order of water mist droplet sizes. The major
    benefit with dry water is the low pressures needed to drive the aerosol.
    An issue encountered with the dry water was flowing it in the way one
    would flow normal water. It was found that at low normal and shear
    stresses, the dry water clathrates would release the water held inside. A
    possible low shear delivery mechanism was discussed that avoids the
    ratholing effect. A continuous dry water production system was also
    designed. Filter loading tests were conducted to determine the quality of
    the dry water collected from the batch and continuous cases. It was
    observed that the ratio of water to silica for the continuous case
    reaches the batch value and is similar to results found in the
    literature. For the batch dry water it was observed that the particle
    size of the dried clathrates does vary with rotational speed of the
    blender and is independent of the type of water used (tap or
    deionized).},

  abstract = {It is well known that a jostled string tends to become knotted;
    yet the factors governing the ``spontaneous'' formation of various knots
    are unclear. We performed experiments in which a string was tumbled
    inside a box and found that complex knots often form within seconds. We
    used mathematical knot theory to analyze the knots. Above a critical
    string length, the probability $P$ of knotting at first increased sharply
    with length but then saturated below 100\%. This behavior differs from
    that of mathematical self-avoiding random walks, where $P$ has been proven
    to approach 100\%. Finite agitation time and jamming of the string due to
    its stiffness result in lower probability, but $P$ approaches 100\% with
    long, flexible strings. We analyzed the knots by calculating their Jones
    polynomials via computer analysis of digital photos of the string.
    Remarkably, almost all were identified as prime knots: 120 different
    types, having minimum crossing numbers up to 11, were observed in 3,415
    trials. All prime knots with up to seven crossings were observed. The
    relative probability of forming a knot decreased exponentially with
    minimum crossing number and M\"{o}bius energy, mathematical measures of
    knot complexity. Based on the observation that long, stiff strings tend to
    form a coiled structure when confined, we propose a simple model to
    describe the knot formation based on random ``braid moves'' of the string
    end. Our model can qualitatively account for the observed distribution of
    knots and dependence on agitation time and string length.},

    with the approaches that caused them.

    How can we understand and effectively intervene in interconnected complex
    adaptive systems, make them flourish and increase their robustness?

    The Internet has increased economic and social complexity while reducing
    costs and friction. This provides us with new tools and opportunities to
    understand, design and intervene in systems.

    I draw on my experience working in organizations and communities to
    describe the post-Internet principles and methods that we can apply to
    tackle these problems: decentralization, a complex ecosystem approach to
    understanding and communication, and a culture-centered community

    magnetic stimulation of V5 at intervals of -20 to +10 ms before or after
    the onset of visual stimulation was effective in abolishing motion
    perception---other delays were not; (ii) magnetic stimulation of V1
    abolished motion perception only marginally and at delays which were
    significantly different from those obtained with V5, the stimulation now
    being effective only at delays of 60--70 ms after the onset of visual
    stimulation. We conclude (i) that stimulation of V5 is a much more potent
    way of inducing akinetopsia (motion imperception) than stimulation of V1;
    (ii) that perceptually effective visual motion signals reach V5 at or
    before 30 ms and reach V1 at or before 60 ms---consequently, perceptually
    effective motion signals reach V5 before they reach V1; (iii) that, given
    the time course of arrival of signals in V1 and V5, it takes about 30--50
    ms for signals from V1 to reach V5. We conclude further that there are
    probably two components reaching V5 from the retina, a fast one which
    bypasses V1 and a slow one which reaches it through V1.},

  abstract = {Recently, the partial information decomposition emerged as a
    promising framework for identifying the meaningful components of the
    information contained in a joint distribution. Its adoption and practical
    application, however, have been stymied by the lack of a
    generally-accepted method of quantifying its components. Here, we briefly
    discuss the bivariate (two-source) partial information decomposition and
    two implicitly directional interpretations used to intuitively motivate
    alternative component definitions. Drawing parallels with secret key
    agreement rates from information-theoretic cryptography, we demonstrate
    that these intuitions are mutually incompatible and suggest that this
    underlies the persistence of competing definitions and interpretations.
    Having highlighted this hitherto unacknowledged issue, we outline several
    possible solutions.},

    to provide a clear foundation for assessing the potential value of
    quantum-based technologies relative to classical alternatives. It is
    hoped that this form of exposition can provide greater clarity of
    perspective than is typically offered by mathematically-focused
    treatments of the topic. It is also hoped that this clarity extends to
    more general applications of quantum information science such as quantum

    low-overhead collaboration, and flexibility of research project plans.},

    protection requires decreased accuracy. Recognizing this as a resource
    allocation problem, we propose an economic solution: operate where the
    marginal cost of increasing privacy equals the marginal benefit. Our
    model of production, from computer science, assumes data are published
    using an efficient differentially private algorithm. Optimal choice
    weighs the demand for accurate statistics against the demand for privacy.
    Examples from U.S.\ statistical programs show how our framework can guide
    decision-making. Further progress requires a better understanding of
    willingness-to-pay for privacy and statistical accuracy.}

        the meaning is opaque to humans. Several instances of nonsensical

        voice-controlled digital assistant, but which were incomprehensible
        to humans, as shown in tests with human experimental subjects. Our

        voice-controlled digital assistants or other speech-controlled
        devices in speech sounds which are perceived by humans as

        a statical associative version, with each version corresponding to a
        competing view of the proper goal of privacy or nondiscrimination.
        Second, for each version, we show that a difference between the
        privacy edition of the version and the nondiscrimination edition of
        the version is related to the difference between Bayesian
        probabilities and frequentist probabilities. In particular, privacy
        admits both Bayesian and frequentist interpretations whereas
        nondiscrimination is limited to the frequentist interpretation. We

    abstract = {We study the impact of signal jamming attacks against the
        communication based train control (CBTC) systems and develop the
        countermeasures to limit the attacks' impact. CBTC supports the train
        operation automation and moving-block signaling, which improves the
        transport efficiency. We consider an attacker jamming the wireless
        communication between the trains or the train to wayside access
        point, which can disable CBTC and the corresponding benefits. In
        contrast to prior work studying jamming only at the physical or link
        layer, we study the real impact of such attacks on end users, namely
        train journey time and passenger congestion. Our analysis employs a
        detailed model of leaky medium-based communication system (leaky
        waveguide or leaky feeder/coaxial cable) popularly used in CBTC
        systems. To counteract the jamming attacks, we develop a mitigation
        approach based on frequency hopping spread spectrum taking into
        account domain-specific structure of the leaky-medium CBTC systems.
        Specifically, compared with existing implementations of FHSS, we
        apply FHSS not only between the transmitter-receiver pair but also at
        the track-side repeaters. To demonstrate the feasibility of
        implementing this technology in CBTC systems, we develop a FHSS
        repeater prototype using software-defined radios on both leaky-medium
        and open-air (free-wave) channels. We perform extensive simulations
        driven by realistic running profiles of trains and real-world
        passenger data to provide insights into the jamming attack's impact
        and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.},

        should not depend on programmers to provide security for end-users as
        majority of programmers are not experts of computer security. On the
        other hand, some studies have revealed that security experts believe
        programmers have a major role to play in ensuring the end-users'
        security. However, there has been no investigation on what
        programmers perceive about their responsibility for the end-users'
        security of applications they develop. In this work, by conducting a
        qualitative experimental study with 40 software developers, we
        attempted to understand the programmer's perception on who is
        responsible for ensuring end-users' security of the applications they
        develop. Results revealed majority of programmers perceive that they
        are responsible for the end-users' security of applications they
        develop. Furthermore, results showed that even though programmers
        aware of things they need to do to ensure end-users' security, they
        do not often follow them. We believe these results would change the
        current view on the role that different stakeholders of the software
        development process (i.e. researchers, security experts, programmers
        and Application Programming Interface (API) developers) have to play

        developers implement DM in a software system design when they are

        implement DM when they are not aware of the potential of data they

        epitaxial composite thin films of tetragonal lead titanate
        (\ce{PbTiO3}), compared to 1.065 in bulk. These thin films with
        super-tetragonal structure possess a giant remanent polarization,
        236.3 microcoulombs per square centimeter, which is almost twice the
        value of known ferroelectrics. The supertetragonal phase is stable up
        to \SI{725}{\celsius}, compared to the bulk transition temperature of
        \SI{490}{\celsius}. The interphase-strain approach could enhance the
        physical properties of other functional materials.},

        can alternately emit and detect light using only an LED, two digital

        first applied to create a smart illumination system that uses a
        single LED as both light source and sensor. We then present several
        devices that use an LED as a generic wireless serial data port. An
        important implication of this work is that every LED connected to a
        microprocessor can be thought of as a wireless two-way communication
        port. We present this technology as a solution to the
        ``last centimeter problem'' because it permits disparate devices to
        communicate with each other simply and cheaply with minimal design

        environment to be more Earth-like in a way that would allow
        terrestrial life (possibly including humans) to survive without the
        need for life-support systems --- in the context of what we know
        about Mars today. We want to answer the question of whether it is
        possible to mobilize gases present on Mars today in non-atmospheric
        reservoirs by emplacing them into the atmosphere, and increase the
        pressure and temperature so that plants or humans could survive at
        the surface. We ask whether this can be achieved considering
        realistic estimates of available volatiles, without the use of new
        technology that is well beyond today's capability. Recent
        observations have been made of the loss of Mars's atmosphere to space
        by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission probe and the
        Mars Express spacecraft, along with analyses of the abundance of
        carbon-bearing minerals and the occurrence of \ce{CO2} in polar ice
        from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Odyssey spacecraft.
        These results suggest that there is not enough \ce{CO2} remaining on
        Mars to provide significant greenhouse warming were the gas to be
        emplaced into the atmosphere; in addition, most of the \ce{CO2} gas
        in these reservoirs is not accessible and thus cannot be readily
        mobilized. As a result, we conclude that terraforming Mars is not
        possible using present-day technology.},

        independent assets on a common block-chain. This is achieved by
        extending the ring confidential transaction with an additional
        commitment to a colour and a publicly verifiable proof of
        conservation. With our coloured confidential ring signatures, new
        token types can be introduced and transferred by any participant
        using the same sized anonymity set as single-token privacy aware
        block-chains. Thereby, our system facilitates tracking assets on an
        immutable ledger without compromising the confidentiality of
        transactions.},

        stopping their experiments based on the p-value of the treatment
        effect. Our data contains 2,101 commercial experiments in which
        experimenters can track the magnitude and significance level of the
        effect every day of the experiment. We use a regression discontinuity
        design to detect p-hacking, i.e., the causal effect of reaching a
        particular p-value on stopping behavior.

        Experimenters indeed p-hack, especially for positive effects.
        Specifically, about 57\% of experimenters p-hack when the experiment
        reaches 90\% confidence. Furthermore, approximately 70\% of the
        effects are truly null, and p-hacking increases the false discovery
        rate (FDR) from 33\% to 42\% among experiments p-hacked at 90\%
        confidence. Assuming that false discoveries cause experimenters to
        stop exploring for more effective treatments, we estimate the
        expected cost of a false discovery to be a loss of 1.95\% in lift,
        which corresponds to the 76th percentile of observed lifts.},

        Internet of Skills. What next? We conjecture that in 15--20 years
        from now we will have the Internet of Neurons, a new Internet
        paradigm in which humans will be able to connect bi-directionally to
        the net using only their brain. The Internet of Neurons will provide
        new, tremendous opportunities thanks to constant access to unlimited
        information. It will empower all those outside of the technical
        industry, actually it will empower all human beings, to access and
        use technological products and services as everybody will be able to
        connect, even without possessing a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone.
        The Internet of Neurons will thus ultimately complete the currently
        still immature democratization of knowledge and technology. But it
        will also bring along several enormous challenges, especially
        concerning security (as well as privacy and trust).

        In this paper we speculate on the worldwide deployment of the
        Internet of Neurons by 2038 and brainstorm about its disruptive
        impact, discussing the main technological (and neurological)
        breakthroughs required to enable it, the new opportunities it
        provides and the security challenges it raises. We also elaborate on
        the novel system models, threat models and security properties that
        are required to reason about privacy, security and trust in the
        Internet of Neurons.},

    abstract = {In an array of $N$ elements, $M$ positions and $M$ elements
        are ``marked''. We show how to permute the elements in the array so
        that all marked elements end in marked positions, in time $O(N)$ (in
        the standard word-RAM model), deterministically, and
        obliviously---{\it i.e.}\ with a sequence of memory accesses that
        depends only on $N$ and not on which elements or positions are
        marked. As a corollary, we answer affirmatively to an open question
        about the existence of a deterministic oblivious algorithm with
        $O(N)$ running time for tight compaction (move the $M$ marked
        elements to the first $M$ positions of the array), a building block
        for several cryptographic constructions. Our $O(N)$ result improves
        the running-time upper bounds for deterministic tight compaction, for
        randomized tight compaction, and for the simpler problem of
        randomized loose compaction (move the M marked elements to the first
        $O(M)$ positions)---until now respectively $O(N \lg N)$, $O(N \lg \lg
        N)$, and $O(N \lg^{*}N)$.},

    abstract = {Finding a balance between privacy and utility, allowing
        researchers and businesses to use data for good while protecting
        people's privacy, is one of the biggest challenge we face today. A
        large body of research has shown the limits of the traditional
        anonymization (or de-identification) model prompting the use of
        question and answer or query-based systems. Diffix is a query-based
        system developed by Aircloak using the concept of ``sticky noise''
        to protect people's privacy. We here present an attack on Diffix that
        exploits the structure of its sticky noise to infer private
        attributes of people in the dataset. We believe this vulnerability to
        be serious, allowing us to accurately infer private information of
        users with little background knowledge. While we share Diffix's
        creators view that we need to take a fresh look at building practical
        privacy-preserving systems, we believe this requires a layered
        security approach and fully open tools and discussions. Patented and
        proprietary code is unlikely to be sufficient to truly help us find a
        balance between the great potential of data and the basic human right

        researchers suggest to add example code to the documentation. Aim: We
        wanted to create a free platform for cryptographic code examples that
        improves the usability and security of created applications by non
        security experts. Method: We created the open-source web platform
        CryptoExamples and conducted a controlled experiment where 58 students
        added symmetric encryption to a Java program. We then measured the
        usability and security. Results: The participants who used the
        platform were not only significantly more effective (+73 \%) but also
        their code contained significantly less possible security
        vulnerabilities (-66 \%). Conclusions: With CryptoExamples the gap
        between hard to change API documentation and the need for complete
        and secure code examples can be closed. Still, the platform needs
        more code examples.},

    abstract = {By comparing cryptocurrencies with other existing payment
        methods, including banknotes and bank cards, it is clear that the use
        of Bitcoin and its competitors (Ethereum, \dots) is almost
        insignificant in world trade. We may also note that these
        cryptocurrencies have become tools of speculation, which is the
        antithesis of their primary purpose.

        Based essentially on the security of electronic signatures, the Ecash
        introduced here will put the users back to the center of the game and
        exclude miners and their enormous waste of power energy. Thus, the
        purpose of this paper is to show that even a piece of paper can be
        recycled into a secure Ecash, while remaining environmentally
        friendly. Hence, we create here a cryptocurrency that would use a
        slight modification of the current banknotes to set up anonymous
        electronic transactions. By trading with banknotes, we mechanically
        transfer ownership of the paper money from one owner to another,
        hence, in this scheme, we introduce the notion of ownership transfer.
        It implies that at each transaction the elements allowing to
        authenticate the Ecash does not change, while the ownership
        certificate will change since the Ecash is transfer towards someone
        else.},

        the social networks of the individuals they investigate. We develop a
        novel method for automatically constructing these networks from
        collected hard drives. We accomplish this by scanning the raw storage
        media for email addresses, constructing co-reference networks based
        on the proximity of email addresses to each other, then selecting
        connected components that correspond to real communication networks.
        We validate our analysis against a tagged data-set of networks for
        which we determined ground truth through interviews with the drive
        owners. In the resulting social networks, we find that classical
        measures of centrality and community detection algorithms are
        effective for identifying important nodes and close associates.},

    abstract = {The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a swarm intelligence
        meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the hunting behaviour and social
        hierarchy of grey wolves in nature. This paper analyses the use of
        chaos theory in this algorithm to improve its ability to escape local
        optima by replacing the key parameters by chaotic variables. The
        optimal choice of chaotic maps is then used to apply the Chaotic Grey
        Wolf Optimizer (CGWO) to the problem of factoring a large semi prime
        into its prime factors. Assuming the number of digits of the factors
        to be equal, this is a computationally difficult task upon which the
        RSA-cryptosystem relies. This work proposes the use of a new
        objective function to solve the problem and uses the CGWO to optimize
        it and compute the factors. It is shown that this function performs
        better than its predecessor for large semi primes and CGWO is an
        efficient algorithm to optimize it.},

    abstract = {Most encrypted data formats, such as PGP, leak substantial
        metadata in their plaintext headers, such as format version,
        encryption schemes used, the number of recipients who can decrypt the
        data, and even the identities of those recipients. This leakage can
        pose security and privacy risks, {\it e.g.}, by revealing the full
        membership of a group of collaborators from a single encrypted E-mail
        between two of them, or enabling an eavesdropper to fingerprint the
        precise encryption software version and configuration the sender used
        and to facilitate targeted attacks against specific endpoint software
        weaknesses. We propose to improve security and privacy hygiene by
        designing future encrypted data formats such that no one without a
        relevant decryption key learns \emph{anything at all} from a
        ciphertext apart from its length---and learns as little as possible
        even from that.

        To achieve this goal we present \emph{Padded Uniform Random Blobs} or
        PURBs, an encrypted format functionally similar to PGP but strongly
        minimizing a ciphertext's leakage via metadata or length. A PURB is
        indistinguishable from a uniform random bit-string to an observer
        without a decryption key. Legitimate recipients can efficiently
        decrypt the PURB even when it is encrypted for any number of
        recipients' public keys and/or passwords, and when those public keys
        are of different cryptographic schemes. PURBs use a novel padding
        scheme to reduce potential information leakage via the ciphertext's
        length $L$ to the asymptotic minimum of $O(\log_2(\log_2(L)))$ bits,
        comparable to padding to a power of two, but with much lower padding
        overhead of at most 12\% which decreases further with large
        payloads.},

        translational degrees of freedom of the trapped microgyroscope leads
        to the observation of positional stabilization in effect cooling the
        particle to \SI{40}{\kelvin}. We attribute this cooling to the

        regulate, creating a ``revolving door'' between government and the

        the US Patent and Trademark Office. We find that patent examiners
        grant significantly more patents to the firms that later hire them
        and that much of this leniency extends to prospective employers.
        These effects are strongest in years when firms are actively hiring,
        and these relationships hold for the intensive margin of intellectual
        property protection. Ultimately, this leads the agency to issue lower
        quality patents, which we measure in citations. Together with other
        supporting evidence, we argue these results are suggestive of
        regulatory capture.},

        building blocks of electronic computers. The idea is not new, but is
        currently subject to intense research as a part of the quest for
        `beyond Moore' electronic devices. In this paper we give an
        engineering-minded survey of oscillator-based computing
        architectures, with the goal of understanding their promise and
        limitations for next-generation computing. We will mostly discuss
        non-Boolean, neurally-inspired computing concepts and put the
        emphasis on hardware and on circuits where the oscillators are
        realized from emerging, nanoscale building blocks. Despite all the
        promise that oscillatory computing holds, existing literature gives
        very few clear-cut arguments about the possible benefits of using
        oscillators in place of other analog nonlinear circuit elements. In
        this survey we will argue for finding the rationale of using
        oscillatory building blocks and call for benchmarking studies that
        compare oscillatory computing circuits to level-based (analog)
        implementations.},

    abstract = {The problem of obfuscating the authorship of a text document
        has received little attention in the literature to date. Current
        approaches are ad-hoc and rely on assumptions about an adversary's
        auxiliary knowledge which makes it difficult to reason about the
        privacy properties of these methods. Differential privacy is a
        well-known and robust privacy approach, but its reliance on the
        notion of adjacency between datasets has prevented its application to
        text document privacy. However, generalised differential privacy
        permits the application of differential privacy to arbitrary datasets
        endowed with a metric and has been demonstrated on problems involving
        the release of individual data points. In this paper we show how to
        apply generalised differential privacy to author obfuscation by
        utilising existing tools and methods from the stylometry and natural
        language processing literature.},

        usually pays attention to the logs except technical department, which
        may periodically check them to ensure that the performance of the
        platform conforms to the Service Level Agreements. However, the
        moment the status of a component changes from acceptable to
        unacceptable, or a customer complains about accessibility or
        performance of a platform, the importance of logs increases
        significantly. Depending on the scope of the issue, all departments,
        including management, customer support, and even the actual customer,
        may turn to logs to find out what has happened, how it has happened,
        and who is responsible for the issue. The party at fault may be
        motivated to tamper the logs to hide their fault. Given the number of
        logs that are generated by the Cloud solutions, there are many
        tampering possibilities. While tamper detection solution can be used
        to detect any changes in the logs, we argue that critical nature of
        logs calls for immutability. In this work, we propose a
        blockchain-based log system, called Logchain, that collects the logs
        from different providers and avoids log tampering by sealing the logs
        cryptographically and adding them to a hierarchical ledger, hence,
        providing an immutable platform for log storage},

    abstract = {Signal is a new security protocol and accompanying app that
        provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging. The core
        protocol has recently been adopted by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger,
        and Google Allo among many others; the first two of these have at
        least 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon
        security properties (such as ``future secrecy'' or ``post-compromise
        security''), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which
        session keys are updated with every message sent. Despite its
        importance and novelty, there has been little to no academic analysis
        of the Signal protocol.

        We conduct the first security analysis of Signal's Key Agreement and
        Double Ratchet as a multi-stage key exchange protocol. We extract
        from the implementation a formal description of the abstract
        protocol, and define a security model which can capture the
        ``ratcheting'' key update structure. We then prove the security of
        Signal's core in our model, demonstrating several standard security
        properties. We have found no major flaws in the design, and hope that
        our presentation and results can serve as a starting point for other
        analyses of this widely adopted protocol.},

        access controls that uses public key cryptography to secure large
        numbers of documents with arbitrarily large numbers of authorized
        users. Our approach uses a proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme to handle
        the problems typical of public key cryptography including key
        management, rotation, and revocation, in a highly scalable way, while
        providing end-to-end encryption and provable access.

        In this paper we describe a system based on this approach. We call it
        an orthogonal access control system, because it allows the decision
        about the groups to which to encrypt a piece of data to be made
        independently and asynchronously from the decision about who belongs
        to a group and can therefore decrypt the data. We define specific
        requirements for a PRE scheme needed to support the system, and we
        provide a specific instance that meets these requirements. We detail
        the algorithms that make up the scheme, and we present an enhancement
        that provides better revocability of keys.},

    abstract = {We review the salient evidence consistent with or predicted
        by the Hoyle--Wickramasinghe (H--W) thesis of Cometary (Cosmic)
        Biology. Much of this physical and biological evidence is
        multifactorial. One particular focus are the recent studies which
        date the emergence of the complex retroviruses of vertebrate lines at
        or just before the Cambrian Explosion of $\sim 500$ Ma. Such viruses
        are known to be plausibly associated with major evolutionary genomic
        processes. We believe this coincidence is not fortuitous but is
        consistent with a key prediction of H--W theory whereby major
        extinction-diversification evolutionary boundaries coincide with
        virus-bearing cometary-bolide bombardment events. A second focus is
        the remarkable evolution of intelligent complexity (Cephalopods)
        culminating in the emergence of the Octopus. A third focus concerns
        the micro-organism fossil evidence contained within meteorites as
        well as the detection in the upper atmosphere of apparent incoming
        life-bearing particles from space. In our view the totality of the
        multifactorial data and critical analyses assembled by Fred Hoyle,
        Chandra Wickramasinghe and their many colleagues since the 1960s
        leads to a very plausible conclusion---life may have been seeded here
        on Earth by life-bearing comets as soon as conditions on Earth
        allowed it to flourish (about or just before 4.1 Billion years ago);
        and living organisms such as space-resistant and space-hardy
        bacteria, viruses, more complex eukaryotic cells, fertilised ova and
        seeds have been continuously delivered ever since to Earth so being
        one important driver of further terrestrial evolution which has
        resulted in considerable genetic diversity and which has led to the
        emergence of mankind.},

        previous breach corpuses. Using a corpus of 320M breached passwords,
        the researcher collected information regarding Asia Pacific College

        performance data from each student's grade history, the researcher
        found that the students in the highest GPA tier had the lowest \% of

        Shannon's Information Theory, and the resulting misinterpretation of

    howpublished = {arXiv preprint 1804.05246 [quant-ph]},
    abstract = {Summoning is a task between two parties, Alice and Bob, with
        distributed networks of agents in space-time. Bob gives Alice a
        random quantum state, known to him but not her, at some point. She is
        required to return the state at some later point, belonging to a
        subset defined by communications received from Bob at other points.
        Many results about summoning, including the impossibility of
        unrestricted summoning tasks and the necessary conditions for
        specific types of summoning tasks to be possible, follow directly
        from the quantum nocloning theorem and the relativistic
        no-superluminal-signalling principle. The impossibility of cloning
        devices can be derived from the impossibility of superluminal
        signalling and the projection postulate, together with assumptions
        about the devices' location-independent functioning. In this
        qualified sense, known summoning results follow from the causal
        structure of space-time and the properties of quantum measurements.
        Bounds on the fidelity of approximate cloning can be similarly
        derived. Bit commitment protocols and other cryptographic protocols
        based on the no-summoning theorem can thus be proven secure against
        some classes of post-quantum but non-signalling adversaries.},

        simultaneous imaging and energy harvesting without introducing
        additional in-plane p-n junctions. The prototype pixel uses a
        vertical $\text{p}^+/\text{n}_\text{well}/\text{p}_\text{sub}$
        junction that is available in standard CMOS processes. Unlike the
        conventional CMOS electron-based imaging pixels, where the
        $\text{n}_\text{well}$ region is used as a sensing node for image
        capture, we adopted a hole-based imaging technique, while exploiting
        the $\text{n}_\text{well}$ region for energy harvesting at a high
        fill-factor of $>94\%$. To verify the feasibility, CMOS image sensors
        are fabricated and characterized. We successfully demonstrated that
        the energy harvesting can be achieved with a power density of 998
        pW/klux/mm\textsuperscript{2}, while capturing images at 74.67
        pJ/pixel. The fabricated prototype device has achieved the highest
        power density among the recent state-of-the-art works and can
        self-sustain its image capturing operation at 15 fps without external
        power sources above $\sim 60$ klux of illumination.},

        one of the physical parameters that are used for the investigation of
        matter. It is an important tool for investigating magnetic and
        electronic properties from both the microscopic and macroscopic
        points of view. The interaction energy of a substance with a magnetic
        field, {\it i.e.}\ Zeeman energy or Landau energy, is small even at a
        field of \SI{2}{\tesla} as can be provided by a conventional
        electromagnet. Compared with the inner energies of a substance,
        magnetic fields as high as possible have been required for obtaining
        fine and detailed information on the internal structure and energy
        states. Due to the strong Maxwell stress, however, it is quite
        difficult to obtain a magnetic field higher than \SI{50}{\tesla} and
        much effort has been dedicated to the development of magnets ever
        since the laboratory electromagnet was invented.

        The purpose of this paper is to describe the physical effects that
        have been investigated and the phenomena that have been revealed
        using high magnetic fields, as well as the development of magnet
        technology and measurement technology. In addition, application to
        materials processing is mentioned as an active application of high

    abstract = {In this work, we examine the feasibility of secure and
        undetectable point-to-point communication in a world where
        governments can read all the encrypted communications of their
        citizens. We consider a world where the only permitted method of
        communication is via a government-mandated encryption scheme,
        instantiated with government-mandated keys. Parties cannot simply
        encrypt ciphertexts of some other encryption scheme, because citizens
        caught trying to communicate outside the government's knowledge
        (e.g., by encrypting strings which do not appear to be natural
        language plaintexts) will be arrested. The one guarantee we suppose
        is that the government mandates an encryption scheme which is
        semantically secure against outsiders: a perhaps reasonable
        supposition when a government might consider it advantageous to
        secure its people's communication against foreign entities. But then,
        what good is semantic security against an adversary that holds all
        the keys and has the power to decrypt?

        We show that even in the pessimistic scenario described, citizens can
        communicate securely and undetectably. In our terminology, this
        translates to a positive statement: all semantically secure
        encryption schemes support subliminal communication. Informally, this
        means that there is a two-party protocol between Alice and Bob where
        the parties exchange ciphertexts of what appears to be a normal
        conversation even to someone who knows the secret keys and thus can
        read the corresponding plaintexts. And yet, at the end of the
        protocol, Alice will have transmitted her secret message to Bob. Our
        security definition requires that the adversary not be able to tell
        whether Alice and Bob are just having a normal conversation using the
        mandated encryption scheme, or they are using the mandated encryption
        scheme for subliminal communication.

        Our topics may be thought to fall broadly within the realm of
        steganography: the science of hiding secret communication within
        innocent-looking messages, or cover objects. However, we deal with
        the non-standard setting of an adversarially chosen distribution of
        cover objects (i.e., a stronger-than-usual adversary), and we take
        advantage of the fact that our cover objects are ciphertexts of a
        semantically secure encryption scheme to bypass impossibility results
        which we show for broader classes of steganographic schemes. We give
        several constructions of subliminal communication schemes under the
        assumption that key exchange protocols with pseudorandom messages
        exist (such as Diffie-Hellman, which in fact has truly random
        messages). Each construction leverages the assumed semantic security
        of the adversarially chosen encryption scheme, in order to achieve
        subliminal communication.},

        LPL features create a new category of good performance with

        magnetic signals. The proposed covert channel works even if a
        smartphone is kept inside a Faraday shielding case, which aims to
        block any type of inbound and outbound wireless communication
        (Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth, etc.). The channel also works if the
        smartphone is set in airplane mode in order to block any
        communication with the device. We implement a malware that controls
        the magnetic fields emanating from the computer by regulating
        workloads on the CPU cores. Sensitive data such as encryption keys,
        passwords, or keylogging data is encoded and transmitted over the
        magnetic signals. A smartphone located near the computer receives
        the covert signals with its magnetic sensor. We present technical
        background, and discuss signal generation, data encoding, and signal
        reception. We show that the proposed covert channel works from a
        user-level process, without requiring special privileges, and can
        successfully operate from within an isolated virtual machine (VM).},

        one component of biodiversity, and others, such as numbers of
        individuals or biomass, are at least as poorly known and just as
        important to quantify. Here, we use a variety of methods to
        estimate the global number of individuals for a single taxon,
        birds. The different methods yield surprisingly consistent
        estimates of a global bird population of between 200 billion and
        400 billion individuals (1 billion=$10^9$). We discuss some of the
        implications of this figure.},

    abstract = {The Dover inherently secure processor being developed at
        Draper extends a conventional CPU (we use an open-source RISC-V
        implementation) with a Policy EXecution coprocessor (PEX). The PEX
        maintains metadata at the granularity of every word accessible by
        the application processor (AP), including registers, and the PEX
        enforces software-defined policies at the granularity of each
        instruction executed by the AP CPU. Hardware interlocks enforce
        strict separation between user-land code \& data and policy-related
        code \& data. Dover achieves high performance by using caches for
        acceptable combinations of instructions and associated metadata.
        Dover maintains flexibility with respect to the host AP CPU by
        imposing minimal changes to the AP CPU. A Dover system, in
        conjunction with a Dover-specialized kernel and modifications tor
        the GCC toolchain, can implement a wide range of security and
        safety policies on top of existing C-based applications.},

        produce international cooperation by providing public goods and
        resolving collective action dilemmas. Successful hegemons also
        resist the temptation to exploit their advantages in order to reduce
        other states' fear of domination. This article asks whether or not
        the internet needs the United States to play a similar role. If so,
        Washington should pursue policies designed to strengthen internet
        security while eschewing espionage and cyberattacks that rely on
        some degree of internet insecurity. If not, it can go on the
        offensive without fear of undermining the system as a whole. We
        examine the technical and political fallout from revealed offensive
        cyberoperations to assess the relative fragility of the internet.
        Our findings suggest that it is relatively resilient.},

        security and robustness of the mainline Linux kernel. However, the
        increasing number of kernel-specific vulnerabilities, especially
        memory safety vulnerabilities, shows that the kernel is a popular
        and practically exploitable target. Two major causes of memory
        safety vulnerabilities are reference counter overflows (temporal
        memory errors) and lack of pointer bounds checking (spatial memory
        errors).

        To succeed in practice, security mechanisms for critical systems
        like the Linux kernel must also consider performance and
        deployability as critical design objectives. We present and
        systematically analyze two such mechanisms for improving memory
        safety in the Linux kernel: (a) an overflow-resistant reference
        counter data structure designed to accommodate typical reference
        counter usage in kernel source code, and (b) runtime pointer bounds
        checking using Intel MPX in the kernel.},

        as writing in memory with defective cells [1][2] is a relevant
        information-theoretical model for a specific case of passive warden
        steganography when the sender embeds a secret message into a subset
        $C$ of the cover object $X$ without sharing $C$ with the recipient.
        The set $C$, also called the selection channel, could be arbitrary,
        determined by the sender from the cover object using a
        deterministic, pseudo-random, or a truly random process. We call
        this steganography ``writing on wet paper'' and realize it using a
        simple variable-rate random linear code that gives the sender a
        convenient flexibility and control over the embedding process and
        is thus suitable for practical implementation. The importance of
        the wet paper scenario for covert communication is discussed within
        the context of adaptive steganography and perturbed quantization
        steganography [3]. Heuristic arguments supported by tests using
        blind steganalysis [4] indicate that the wet paper steganography
        provides improved steganographic security and is less vulnerable
        to steganalytic attacks compared to existing methods with shared
        selection channels.},

    abstract = {Software implementations of discrete logarithm based
        cryptosystems over finite fields typically make the assumption that
        any domain parameters they are presented with are trustworthy, i.e.,
        the parameters implement cyclic groups where the discrete logarithm
        problem is assumed to be hard.

        An informal and widespread justification for this seemingly exists
        that says validating parameters at run time is too computationally
        expensive relative to the perceived risk of a server sabotaging the
        privacy of its own connection. In this paper we explore this trust
        assumption and examine situations where it may not always be
        justified.

        We conducted an investigation of discrete logarithm domain
        parameters in use across the Internet and discovered evidence of a
        multitude of potentially backdoored moduli of unknown order in TLS
        and STARTTLS spanning numerous countries, organizations, and
        protocols. Although our disclosures resulted in a number of
        organizations taking down suspicious parameters, we argue the
        potential for TLS backdoors is systematic and will persist until
        either until better parameter hygiene is taken up by the community,
        or finite field based cryptography is eliminated altogether.},

    abstract = {\emph{Background:} Cardiac arrest (CA) survivors experience
        cognitive deficits including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
        It is unclear whether these are related to cognitive/mental
        experiences and awareness during CPR. Despite anecdotal reports the
        broad range of cognitive/mental experiences and awareness associated
        with CPR has not been systematically studied.

        \emph{Methods:} The incidence and validity of awareness together
        with the range, characteristics and themes relating to
        memories/cognitive processes during CA was investigated through a 4
        year multi-center observational study using a three stage
        quantitative and qualitative interview system. The feasibility of
        objectively testing the accuracy of claims of visual and auditory
        awareness was examined using specific tests. The outcome measures
        were (1) awareness/memories during CA and (2) objective verification
        of claims of awareness using specific tests.

        \emph{Results:} Among 2060 CA events, 140 survivors completed stage 1
        interviews, while 101 of 140 patients completed stage 2 interviews.
        46\% had memories with 7 major cognitive themes: fear; animals/plants;
        bright light; violence/persecution; deja-vu; family; recalling events
        post-CA and 9\% had NDEs, while 2\% described awareness with explicit
        recall of `seeing' and `hearing' actual events related to their
        resuscitation. One had a verifiable period of conscious awareness
        during which time cerebral function was not expected.},

        different settings corresponding to different moral approaches

        manufacturers/programmers would be tasked with enabling the

    abstract = {Matrix Multiplication (MM) is a fundamental operation of
        modern computing, and an important component of algorithms that
        solve problems in linear algebra, combinatorics, graph theory, and
        machine learning, to name a few. MM's computational time dominates
        their total time: such problems can be solved fast if MM is solved
        fast.

        Directly applying MM's definition to two $n\by n$ matrices yields a
        straightforward algorithm in $O(n^3)$. In 1969, Volker Strassen
        shook the algorithmic world with his paper ``Gaussian elimination
        is not optimal'', by describing a sub-cubic construction in
        $O(n^{\log_7})$. A worldwide effort in search of the optimal
        algorithm ensued.

        In the early 1970s, it was expected that the cubic time algorithm
        would soon be accelerated to enable MM in nearly quadratic
        arithmetic time, with some far-fetched implications.  While
        pursuing this goal, mainstream research had its focus on the
        decrease of the classical exponent 3 towards its lower bound 2,
        disregarding the growth of the input size required to support this
        decrease. Combinations of novel ideas and sophisticated techniques
        reduced the exponent to its benchmark value of about 2.38, but the
        resulting MM algorithms improved the straightforward one only for
        inputs of immense sizes. Today, data communication complexity,
        rather than arithmetic complexity, has become the bottleneck of
        computations.

        We will describe the path traveled to decrease the exponent below
        2.5, and reassess the route for fast MM in present times.

        number in only one bit. We present two methods to compute Gray codes
        containing exactly $n$ numbers in the range $0$ to $n-1$---that is,
        a permutation of $0,1,\ldots ,n-1$ in which each number differs from
        the preceding number in only one bit---where $n$ is unconstrained.
        The first method produces a Gray code that is not cyclic: the first
        and last numbers in the sequence differ in more than one bit. The
        second method produces a cyclic Gray code if $n$ is even, so that
        the first and last numbers differ in only one bit, at the expense of
        a slightly more complicated procedure. Both methods are based on the
        standard binary reflected Gray code and, as in the binary reflected
        Gray code, each number in the output sequence can be computed in a
        constant number of word operations given just its index in the

        simulations for a large number of important problems. The answer to
        the question{\textemdash}whether there is a fundamental obstruction

        systems{\textemdash}remains unclear. Focusing on systems with bosonic

        appear as obstructions to local sign-free QMC. In condensed matter
        physics settings, these responses, such as thermal Hall conductance,
        are associated with fractional quantum Hall effects. We show that
        similar arguments also hold in the case of spontaneously broken
        time-reversal (TR) symmetry such as in the chiral phase of a
        perturbed quantum Kagome antiferromagnet. The connection between

        manifested in certain vertex models, where TR symmetry is preserved.},

    abstract = {Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to
        believe that events and power relations are secretly manipulated
        by certain clandestine groups and organisations. Many of these
        ostensibly explanatory conjectures are non-falsifiable, lacking
        in evidence or demonstrably false, yet public acceptance remains
        high. Efforts to convince the general public of the validity of
        medical and scientific findings can be hampered by such narratives,
        which can create the impression of doubt or disagreement in areas
        where the science is well established. Conversely, historical
        examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult
        for people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious
        assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathematical model
        for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time, which yields
        failure probability for any given conspiracy. Parameters for the
        model are estimated from literature examples of known scandals,
        and the factors influencing conspiracy success and failure are
        explored. The model is also used to estimate the likelihood of
        claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are
        namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax,
        vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being
        suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict
        that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the most
        generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of active
        participants---the results of this model suggest that large
        conspiracies ($\ge 1000$ agents) quickly become untenable and prone
        to failure. The theory presented here might be useful in
        counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences of bogus and
        anti-science narratives, and examining the hypothetical conditions
        under which sustainable conspiracy might be possible.},

        for smartphones. Often, sensitive personal information but also
        confidential business information is shared. End-to-end
        security is required to protect against wiretapping of voice
        calls. For such real-time communication, the ZRTP key-agreement
        protocol has been proposed. By verbally comparing a small number
        of on-screen characters or words, called Short Authentication
        Strings, the participants can be sure that no one is wiretapping
        the call. Since 2011, ZRTP is an IETF standard implemented in
        several VoIP clients. In this paper, we analyzed attacks on
        real-world VoIP systems, in particular those implementing the
        ZRTP standard. We evaluate the protocol compliance, error
        handling, and user interfaces of the most common ZRTP-capable
        VoIP clients. Our extensive analysis uncovered a critical
        vulnerability that allows wiretapping even though Short
        Authentication Strings are compared correctly. We discuss
        shortcomings in the clients' error handling and design of
        security indicators potentially leading to insecure connections.

        deep-rooted difference between waves and objects regarding
        temporal reversibility and particlelike objects. In
        nondissipative chaos, the dynamic of waves always remains time
        reversible, unlike that of particles. Here, we explore the
        dynamics of a waveparticle entity. It consists in a drop
        bouncing on a vibrated liquid bath, self-propelled and piloted
        by the surface waves it generates. This walker, in which there
        is an information exchange between the particle and the wave,
        can be analyzed in terms of a Turing machine with waves as the
        information repository. The experiments reveal that in this
        system, the drop can read information backwards while erasing
        it. The drop can thus backtrack on its previous trajectory. A
        transient temporal reversibility, restricted to the drop motion,
        is obtained in spite of the system being both dissipative and
        chaotic.},

        Authorities},
    year = 2016,
    booktitle = {{ESORICS} 2016},
    abstract = {Nearly all verifiable e-voting schemes require trustworthy
        authorities to perform the tallying operations. An exception is the
        DRE-i system which removes this requirement by pre-computing all
        encrypted ballots before the election using random factors that will
        later cancel out and allow the public to verify the tally after the
        election. While the removal of tallying authorities significantly
        simplifies election management, the pre-computation of ballots
        necessitates secure ballot storage, as leakage of precomputed ballots
        endangers voter privacy. In this paper, we address this problem and
        propose DRE-ip (DRE-i with enhanced privacy). Adopting a different
        design strategy, DRE-ip is able to encrypt ballots in real time in
        such a way that the election tally can be publicly verified without
        decrypting the cast ballots. As a result, DRE-ip achieves end-to-end
        verifiability without tallying authorities, similar to DRE-i, but
        with a significantly stronger guarantee on voter privacy. In the
        event that the voting machine is fully compromised, the assurance on
        tallying integrity remains intact and the information leakage is
        limited to the minimum: only the partial tally at the time of
        compromise is leaked.},

        in order to test the behavior of their libraries. Based on
        TLS-Attacker, we present a two-stage fuzzing approach to

        searches for cryptographic failures and boundary violation
        vulnerabilities. It allowed us to find unusual padding oracle
        vulnerabilities and overflows/overreads in widely used TLS
        libraries, including OpenSSL, Botan, and MatrixSSL. Our
        findings motivate developers to create comprehensive test
        suites, including positive as well as negative tests, for the
        evaluation of TLS libraries. We use TLS-Attacker to create
        such a test suite framework which finds further problems in
        Botan.

        lowest asymptotic time complexity for known pre-quantum factoring
        algorithms, assuming standard heuristics, is $L^{p+o(1)}$ where
        $p > 1.9$. The new time complexity is asymptotically worse than
        Shor's algorithm, but the qubit requirements are asymptotically
        better, so it may be possible to physically implement it sooner.},

        tools that allows users to focus on problem solving rather than on the
        peripheral activities of programming.

        Interactive software plays a vital role in reducing the burden on the
        user in describing the various information types. It prompts for
        information regarding identification of controllable parameters,
        generation of the goal scenario, and definition of performance
        criteria. Efforts are made to supply the user with as much information
        as is currently defined in the model base when eliciting responses.
        Further, the SES model specification language is specifically designed
        to support a library of model parts. Such a library serves as a
        corporate memory of past simulation studies and contains information on
        component behaviours, transaction sequences, and analysis rules.

        scanner artifacts. With current scanner technology, the resulting
        camera system is capable of taking black\&white, color, or near-infrared

        achieve actual optical resolutions close to the theoretical maximum,

        We present an account of the TLS standardisation narrative,
        examining the differences between the reactive standardisation
        process for TLS 1.2 and below, and the more proactive
        standardisation process for TLS 1.3. We explore the possible factors
        that have contributed to the shift in the TLS WG's design mindset,
        considering the protocol analysis tools available, the levels of
        academic involvement and the incentives governing relevant
        stakeholders at the time of standardisation. In an attempt to place
        TLS within the broader realm of standardisation, we perform a
        comparative analysis of standardisation models and discuss the
        standardisation of TLS within this context.

    abstract = {Robots are now associated with various aspects of our
        lives. These sophisticated machines have been increasingly used in
        different manufacturing industries and services sectors for decades.
        During this time, they have been a factor in causing significant harm
        to humans, prompting questions of liability. Industrial robots are
        presently regarded as products for liability purposes. In contrast,
        some commentators have proposed that robots be granted legal
        personality, with an overarching aim of exonerating the respective
        creators and users of these artefacts from liability. This article is
        concerned mainly with industrial robots that exercise some degree of
        self-control as programmed, though the creation of fully autonomous
        robots is still a long way off. The proponents of the robot's
        personality compare these machines generally with corporations, and
        sporadically with, inter alia, animals, and idols, in substantiating
        their arguments. This article discusses the attributes of legal
        personhood and the justifications for the separate personality of
        corporations and idols. It then demonstrates the reasons for refusal of
        an animal's personality. It concludes that robots are ineligible to be
        persons, based on the requirements of personhood.

        protect user passwords against server compromise by distributing the
        capability to verify passwords over multiple servers. Password
        verification is a single-round protocol and requires from each server
        only one exponentiation in a prime-order group. In spite of its
        simplicity, our scheme boasts security against dynamic and transient
        corruptions, meaning that servers can be corrupted at any time and can
        recover from corruption by going through a non-interactive key refresh
        procedure. The users' passwords remain secure against offline
        dictionary attacks as long as not all servers are corrupted within the
        same time period between refreshes. The only currently known scheme to
        achieve such strong security guarantees incurs the considerable cost of
        several hundred exponentiations per server. We prove our scheme secure
        in the universal composability model, which is well-known to offer
        important benefits for password-based primitives, under the gap
        one-more Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random-oracle model. Server
        initialization and refresh must take place in a trusted execution
        environment. Initialization additionally requires a secure message to
        each server,but the refresh procedure is non-interactive. We show that
        these requirements are easily met in practice by providing an example
        deployment architecture.},

        applications include monitoring, debugging, and watermarking.
        For the communication, we do not need any further resources,
        like IO pins or modifications of the board. We characterize the
        communication channel over the power pins and build a channel
        model. Furthermore, we present an encoding/decoding method
        which is independent of the board type and FPGA combination.
        With this approach, we achieve data rates up to 500 kbit/s.
        Finally, we provide a case study, which extends existing power
        watermarking techniques to the new encoding/decoding method
        and show experimental decoding results.

        potential to provide reliable communication with an estimated

        sample, going from transparent, to black, to a reflective metal,
        the latter studied at a pressure of \SI{495}{\giga\pascal}. We
        have measured the reflectance as a function of wavelength in the
        visible spectrum finding values as high as 0.90 from the metallic
        hydrogen. We have fit the reflectance using a Drude free electron
        model to determine the plasma frequency of \SI{30.1}{\electronvolt}
        at $\text{T=} \SI{5.5}{\K}, with a corresponding electron carrier
        density of $6.7\times 10^{23}$ particles/\si{\cubic\centi\metre},
        consistent with theoretical estimates. The properties are those
        of a metal. Solid metallic hydrogen has been produced in the
        laboratory.},

    abstract = {In practicable multi-level secure systems it is necessary
      occasionally to transfer information in violation of security policy.
      Machines for doing this reliably and securely are called cross domain
      solutions; systems incorporating them are cross domain systems. Data
      owners, especially in classified environments, tend to distrust other
      data owners, other systems and networks, their own users, and
      developers of cross domain solutions. Hence, data owners demand
      rigorous testing before they will allow their information into a cross
      domain system. The interests of data owners are represented by
      certifiers and accreditors, who test newly developed cross domain
      solutions and newly installed cross domain systems, respectively.
      Accreditors have the authority to grant approval to operate and the
      responsibility for accepting residual risk. Certification and
      accreditation have always been expensive and time consuming, but there
      are hidden inefficiencies and unexploited opportunities to predict the
      actions of accreditors and to control the cost of certification. Some
      case studies of successful and unsuccessful security certifications and
      accreditations were analysed using grounded theory methodology. It was
      discovered that inefficiency arises from conflation of the principle of
      defence in depth with the practice of independent verification and
      validation, resulting in an irresistible appearance of cost savings to
      managers with a possible explanation in the relative maturity of
      different levels of software engineering organisations with respect to
      policy, process, and procedures. It was discovered that there is a
      simple rule relating certifier findings to developer responses that
      predicts the duration of penetration testing and can be used to bound
      the schedule. An abstract model of cross domain system accreditation
      was developed that is sufficiently powerful to reason about collateral,
      compartmented, and international installations. It was discovered that
      the behaviour of accreditors satisfies the criteria for reliable
      signalling in the presence of asymmetric information due to Akerlof,
      Spence, and Stiglitz.},

        states that a licensed driver is operating the vehicle---the

        believed that the vehicle was autonomous; this provides a lens onto
        the attitudes and concerns that people in real-world autonomous
        vehicles might have, and also points to ways that a protocol
        that deliberately used misdirection could gain ecologically valid
        reactions from study participants.},

        and GPS traces recorded with high temporal resolution, and find
        that time series of WiFi scans contain a strong latent location
        signal. In fact, due to inherent stability and low entropy of
        human mobility, it is possible to assign location to WiFi access
        points based on a very small number of GPS samples and then
        use these access points as location beacons. Using just one GPS
        observation per day per person allows us to estimate the location
        of, and subsequently use, WiFi access points to account for 80\%
        of mobility across a population. These results reveal a great
        opportunity for using ubiquitous WiFi routers for high-resolution
        outdoor positioning, but also significant privacy implications of
        such side-channel location tracking.},

    title = {{NeuronVisor}: Towards a Software Defined Cloud Root-of-Trust
        Framework},
    journal = {Submitted to journal; in preparation},
    year = 2015,
    abstract = {Security issues have become a significant barrier to
        the adoption of cloud computing services. Most existing security
        enhancements lack a definition of trust. Models for Trusted Clouds
        have been proposed, which establish Roots-of-Trust inside the cloud
        and vouch for the trustworthiness of the cloud services. However,
        these are often impractical due to cloud's dynamics and
        complexity. In this paper, we present the \emph{NeuronVisor}, an
        abstract \emph{Cloud Root-of-Trust (cRoT)} framework. NeuronVisor
        enforces decentralized attestations to capture trust dependency
        among interacting software components inside the cloud, and
        determines a single \emph{cRoT} for each cloud application. This
        \emph{cRoT} hides the cloud's internal by presenting a uniform
        interface for attesting to the trustworthiness of the entire cloud
        application and all its dependent services inside the cloud. Based
        on \emph{cRoT}, custom attestation delegates can be implemented to
        examine the properties of cloud resource without requiring excess
        exposure to the underlying implementation detail. Our simulations
        show that, for more than 98\% times, one interrogation to the
        dynamically formed \emph{cRoT} is able to identify the properties
        of more than 90\% of the nodes hosting a cloud application and its
        cloud TCB. Meanwhile, NeuronVisor achieves higher fault detection
        rate than the prevalent centralized cloud attestation scheme
        (CEN). It still achieves the same fault detection rate with CEN
        even when 90\% of the NeuronVisors are constantly tampered with and
        maliciously collaborating with each other.},

        changing blocks to arbitrary strings. We rigorously prove that
        $\mathcal{RSS}$s are less expressive than $\mathcal{SSS}$s:
        no unforgeable $\mathcal{RSS}$ can be transformed into an
        $\mathcal{SSS}$. For the opposite direction we give a black-box
        transformation of a single $\mathcal{SSS}$, with tightened
        security, into an $\mathcal{RSS}$.},

        limit the noise's range and keep a verifiable level of integrity of

        identification from sensor fingerprints. To overcome the problem
        of acquiring a large number of cameras and taking the images,
        we utilized Flickr, an existing on-line image sharing site. In
        our experiment, we tested over one million images spanning 6896
        individual cameras covering 150 models. The gathered data provides
        practical estimates of false acceptance and false rejection rates,
        giving us the opportunity to compare the experimental data with
        theoretical estimates. We also test images against a database of
        fingerprints, simulating thus the situation when a forensic analyst
        wants to find if a given image belongs to a database of already
        known cameras. The experimental results set a lower bound on the
        performance and reveal several interesting new facts about camera
        fingerprints and their impact on error analysis in practice. We
        believe that this study will be a valuable reference for forensic
        investigators in their effort to use this method in court.},

    abstract = {This tutorial explains how photo-response non-uniformity
        (PRNU) of imaging sensors can be used for a variety of important
        digital forensic tasks, such as device identification, device
        linking, recovery of processing history, and detection of digital
        forgeries. The PRNU is an intrinsic property of all digital
        imaging sensors due to slight variations among individual pixels
        in their ability to convert photons to electrons. Consequently,
        every sensor casts a weak noise-like pattern onto every image it
        takes. This pattern, which plays the role of a sensor fingerprint,
        is essentially an unintentional stochastic spread-spectrum
        watermark that survives processing, such as lossy compression
        or filtering. This tutorial explains how this fingerprint can be
        estimated from images taken by the camera and later detected in
        a given image to establish image origin and integrity. Various
        forensic tasks are formulated as a two-channel hypothesis
        testing problem approached using the generalized likelihood
        ratio test. The performance of the introduced forensic methods is
        briefly illustrated on examples to give the reader a sense of the
        performance.},

		a previously unreported vulnerability in EMV protocol, which allows
		EMV contactless cards to approve unlimited value transactions
		without the cardholder's PIN when the transaction is carried out in
		a foreign currency. For example, we have found that Visa credit
		cards will approve foreign currency transactions for any amount up
		to \EUR{999,999.99} with out the cardholder's PIN, this side-steps
		\pounds 20 contactless transaction limit in the UK. This paper
		outlines our analysis methodology that identified the flaw in the
		EMV protocol, and presents a scenario in which fraudulent
		transaction details are transmitted over the Internet to a rogue
		merchant who then uses the transaction data to take money from the
		victim's account. In reality, the criminals would choose a value
		between \EUR{100} and \EUR{200}, which is low enough to be within
		the victim's balance and not to raise suspicion, but high enough to
		make each attack worthwhile. The attack is novel in that it could
		be operated on a large scale with multiple attackers collecting
		fraudulent transactions for a central rogue merchant which can be
		located anywhere in the world where EMV payments are accepted.},

		designs on cave walls---a means of recording and transmitting
		symbolic codes in a durable manner---is recognized as a major
		cognitive step in human evolution. Considered exclusive to
		modern humans, this behavior has been used to argue in favor of
		significant cognitive differences between our direct ancestors
		and contemporary archaic hominins, including the Neanderthals.
		Here we present the first known example of an abstract pattern
		engraved by Neanderthals, from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar. It
		consists of a deeply impressed cross-hatching carved into the
		bedrock of the cave that has remained covered by an undisturbed
		archaeological level containing Mousterian artifacts made by
		Neanderthals and is older than 39 cal kyr BP. Geochemical
		analysis of the epigenetic coating over the engravings and
		experimental replication show that the engraving was made
		before accumulation of the archaeological layers, and that most
		of the lines composing the design were made by repeatedly and
		carefully passing a pointed lithic tool into the grooves,
		excluding the possibility of an unintentional or utilitarian
		origin ({\it e.g.}, food or fur processing). This discovery
		demonstrates the capacity of the Neanderthals for abstract
		thought and expression through the use of geometric forms.},

	abstract = {Financial crises appear throughout human history. While there are many
		schools of thought on what the actual causes of such crises are, it has been
		suggested that the creation of credit money might be a source of financial
		instability. We discuss how the credit mechanism in a system of fractional
		reserve banking leads to non-local transfers of purchasing power that also
		affect non-involved agents. To overcome this issue, we impose the local
		symmetry of time homogeneity on the monetary system. A bi-currency system of
		non-bank assets (money) and bank assets (antimoney) is considered. A payment
		is either made by passing on money or by receiving antimoney. As a result, a
		free floating exchange rate between non-bank assets and bank assets is
		established. Credit creation is replaced by the simultaneous transfer of money
		and antimoney at a negotiated exchange rate. This is in contrast to traditional
		discussions of full reserve banking, which stalls creditary lending. With money
		and antimoney, the problem of credit crunches is mitigated while a full time
		symmetry of the monetary system is maintained. As a test environment for such a
		monetary system, we discuss an economy of random transfers. Random transfers
		are a strong criterion to probe the stability of monetary systems. The analysis
		using statistical physics provides analytical solutions and confirms that a
		money--antimoney system could be functional. Equally important to the probing
		of the stability of such a monetary system is the question of how to implement
		the credit default dynamics. This issue remains open.},

	year = 2013,
	abstract = {Anonymous credentials provide a powerful tool for making
    assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation
    of today's anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted
    credential issuer---which is both a single point of failure and a target
    for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it
    challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the
    {\it ad hoc} network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where
    no single party can be trusted with this responsibility.  In this work we
    propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a
    trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the
    area of electronic cash and uses techniques---such as the calculation of a
    distributed transaction ledger---that are currently in widespread
    deployment in the Bitcoin payment system. Using this decentralized ledger
    and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of
    security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make
    flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees. Finally, we
    discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including
    resource management in {\it ad hoc} networks and prevention of Sybil
    attacks. We implement our scheme and measure its efficiency.},

		database. The consequences of unstable code range
		from incorrect functionality to missing security checks.
		To reason about unstable code, this paper proposes
		a novel model, which views unstable code in terms of
		optimizations that leverage undefined behavior. Using
		this model, we introduce a new static checker called \textsc{Stack}
		that precisely identifies unstable code. Applying \textsc{Stack}
		to widely used systems has uncovered 160 new bugs that

    is essential for trust in and reuse of data. However, little empirical
    research has been conducted to more closely examine this assumption. This
    qualitative study explores how provenance affects end-users' trust in and
    reuse of data. Toward this end, the authors conducted semi-structured
    interviews with 17 proteomics researchers who interact with data from
    ProteomeCommons.org, a large scientific data repository. Empirical findings
    from this study suggest that provenance does help end-users gauge the
    trustworthiness of data and build their confidence in reusing data.
    However, provenance also needs to be accompanied by other kinds of
    information, including: more specific data quality information, the data
    itself, and author reputation information. Implications of this study
    stress the value of end-user studies in provenance research, specifically
    to assess the `real-world' impact of provenance encoded and communicated to
    end-users in systems.},

    secrecy and authenticity of data transfers between a user's input/output
    (I/O) device and a program trusted by that user. We argue that, despite its
    incontestable necessity, current commodity systems do not support trusted
    path with any significant assurance. This paper presents a hypervisor-based
    design that enables a trusted path to bypass an untrusted operating-system,
    applications, and I/O devices, with a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
    We also suggest concrete I/O architectural changes that will simplify
    future trusted-path system design. Our system enables users to verify the
    states and configurations of one or more trusted-paths using a simple,
    secret-less, hand-held device. We implement a simple user-oriented trusted
    path as a case study.},

    is captured by an instruction trace. We show that powerful computation on
    x86 processors is possible without executing any CPU instructions. We
    demonstrate a Turing-complete execution environment driven solely by the
    IA32 architecture's interrupt handling and memory translation tables, in
    which the processor is trapped in a series of page faults and double
    faults, without ever successfully dispatching any instructions. The
    ``hard-wired'' logic of handling these faults is used to perform arithmetic
    and logic primitives, as well as memory reads and writes. This mechanism
    can also perform branches and loops if the memory is set up and mapped just
    right. We discuss the lessons of this execution model for future
    trustworthy architectures.},

	year = 2013,
	abstract = {Using public data (Forbes Global 2000) we show that the
    distribution of asset sizes for the largest global firms follows a Pareto
    distribution in an intermediate range that is ``interrupted'' by a sharp
    cutoff in its upper tail, which is totally dominated by financial firms.
    This contrasts with a large body of empirical\ literature which finds a
    Pareto distribution for firm sizes both across countries and over time.
    Pareto distributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of
    proportional random growth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale:
    this makes our evidence of an ``interrupted'' Pareto distribution all the
    more puzzling, because we provide evidence that financial firms in our
    sample operate in such a regime. We claim that the missing mass from the
    upper tail of the asset size distribution is a consequence of shadow
    banking activity and that it provides an estimate of the size of the shadow
    banking system. This estimate---that we propose as a shadow banking
    index---compares well with estimates of the Financial Stability Board until
    2009, but it shows a sharper rise in shadow banking activity after 2010.},

    examples of emotional display at work and notes the ritualized form of such
    display. The following sections provide working definitions for culture and
    emotion and tie the two together conceptually. The main body of the paper
    presents two brief ethnographies detailing how organizational life is
    structured to channel, mold, enhance, sustain, challenge, and otherwise
    influence the feeling or organizational members---toward the organization
    itself, others in the organization, customers of the organization, and
    crucially, themselves. Disneyland and High Technology Incorporated (a
    pseudonym) are the two organizations studied. The paper concludes by
    considering how these two organizational cultures are built and maintained,

		do not provide scalable, manageable, effective, and efficient

		more end-users start using smart devices (e.g.\ smart phones,
		smart home appliances, etc.) the need to have more scalable,
		manageable, understandable and easy to use access control
		mechanisms increases. This paper describes a capability based
		access control system that enterprises, or even individuals, can
		use to manage their own access control processes to services and
		information. The proposed mechanism supports rights delegation and
		a more sophisticated access control customization. The proposed

    hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are hypersensitive to a variety of
    inhibitory cytokines, one of which, TNF$\alpha$, can induce BM failure and
    clonal evolution in \emph{Fancc}-deficient mice. FANCC-deficient
    macrophages are also hypersensitive to TLR activation and produce
    TNF$\alpha$ in an unrestrained fashion. Reasoning that suppression of
    inhibitory cytokine production might enhance hematopoiesis, we screened
    small molecules using TLR agonist--stimulated FANCC- and Fanconi anemia,
    complementation group A (FANCA)--deficient macrophages containing an
    NF-$\kappa$B/AP-1--responsive reporter gene (\emph{SEAP}). Of the 75 small
    molecules screened, the p38 MAPK inhibitor BIRB 796 and dasatinib potently
    suppressed TLR8-dependent expression of the reporter gene. Fanconi anemia
    (FA) macrophages were hypersensitive to the TLR7/8 activator R848,
    overproducing SEAP and TNF$\alpha$ in response to all doses of the agonist.
    Low doses (50nM) of both agents inhibited p38 MAPK--dependent activation of
    MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and suppressed MK2-dependent TNF$\alpha$ production without
    substantially influencing TNF$\alpha$ gene transcription. Overproduction of
    TNF$\alpha$ by primary FA cells was likewise suppressed by these agents and
    involved inhibition of MK2 activation. Because MK2 is also known to
    influence production and/or sensitivity to 2 other suppressive factors
    (MIP-1$\alpha$ and IFN$\gamma$) to which FA hematopoietic progenitor cells
    are uniquely vulnerable, targeting of p38 MAPK in FA hematopoietic cells is
    a rational objective for preclinical evaluation.},

	abstract = {(Moore's Law applied to the complexity of life from mammals to
    fish to worms to eukaryotes to prokaryotes to zero suggests that life's
    complexity began around $9.7\pm 2.5$ billion years ago. The doubling time
    in this case is 376 million years.) An extrapolation of the genetic
    complexity of organisms to earlier times suggests that life began before
    the Earth was formed. Life may have started from systems with single
    heritable elements that are functionally equivalent to a nucleotide. The
    genetic complexity, roughly measured by the number of non-redundant
    functional nucleotides, is expected to have grown exponentially due to
    several positive feedback factors: gene cooperation, duplication of genes
    with their subsequent specialization, and emergence of novel functional
    niches associated with existing genes. Linear regression of genetic
    complexity on a log scale extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests
    the time of the origin of life 9.7 billion years ago. This cosmic time
    scale for the evolution of life has important consequences: life took ca. 5
    billion years to reach the complexity of bacteria; the environments in
    which life originated and evolved to the prokaryote stage may have been
    quite different from those envisaged on Earth; there was no intelligent
    life in our universe prior to the origin of Earth, thus Earth could not
    have been deliberately seeded with life by intelligent aliens; Earth was
    seeded by panspermia; experimental replication of the origin of life from
    scratch may have to emulate many cumulative rare events; and the Drake
    equation for guesstimating the number of civilizations in the universe is
    likely wrong, as intelligent life has just begun appearing in our universe.
    Evolution of advanced organisms has accelerated via development of
    additional information-processing systems: epigenetic memory, primitive
    mind, multicellular brain, language, books, computers, and Internet. As a
    result the doubling time of complexity has reached ca. 20 years. Finally,
    we discuss the issue of the predicted technological singularity and give a
    biosemiotics perspective on the increase of complexity.},

    intrinsic limitation that the target molecules must be obtained as single
    crystals. Here we report a protocol for SCD analysis that does not require
    the crystallization of the sample. In our method, tiny crystals of porous
    complexes are soaked in a solution of the target, such that the complexes
    can absorb the target molecules. Crystallographic analysis clearly
    determines the absorbed guest structures along with the host frameworks.
    Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one tiny crystal of the
    complex, the required sample mass is of the nanogram gram order. We
    demonstrate that as little as about 80 nanograms of a sample is enough for
    the SCD analysis. In combination with high-performance liquid
    chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization of multiple
    fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography SCD
    analysis. Furthermore, we unambiguously determined the structure of a
    scarce marine natural product using only 5 micrograms of the compound.},

    secure de-duplication (space-efficient secure outsourced storage), a goal
    currently targeted by numerous cloud-storage providers. We provide
    definitions both for privacy and for a form of integrity that we call tag
    consistency. Based on this foundation, we make both practical and
    theoretical contributions. On the practical side, we provide ROM [(Random
    Oracle Model)] security analyses of a natural family of MLE schemes that
    includes deployed schemes. On the theoretical side the challenge is
    standard model solutions, and we make connections with deterministic
    encryption, hash functions secure on correlated inputs and the
    sample-then-extract paradigm to deliver schemes under different assumptions
    and for different classes of message sources. Our work shows that MLE is a
    primitive of both practical and theoretical interest.},

	year = 2012,
	pages = {19--28},
	abstract = {The difficulty of cross domain systems security accreditation
    lies inherent in the fact that, by definition, such systems always span at
    least one boundary between security domains controlled by different data
    owners. Consequently, approved solutions regularly encounter security
    testing criteria that represent the duplicated responsibility for residual
    risk of multiple security accreditors. Each data owner perceives a
    site-specific set of risks that would be desirable to mitigate, a
    technology-dependent set of risks that it is possible to mitigate, and a
    residual risk it is felt acceptable not to mitigate. Time and cost
    inefficiency in cross domain system accreditation are shown to originate
    from asymmetry of knowledge; Spence's criteria for market signalling are
    shown to hold by analogy for accreditor--accreditor communication in the
    presence of unequal or non-hierarchical security clearances. By formalising
    signals, an efficient route to agreement about the true level of residual
    risk might avoid repeated re-testing and redundant risk mitigations. If
    successful, the unnecessarily high cost of duplicated security test and
    evaluation effort could be greatly reduced.},

	abstract = {An automated interactive redaction assistant prototype was
    developed. Based on the Web 1T 5-gram corpus, a list of every unique word
    and phrase in the English language, up to five words in length, that were
    observed on the World Wide Web and collected by Google, Inc. in 2006, the
    CLOAK system automatically flags candidate words, phrases, sentences, and
    paragraphs in documents under review that are likely classified and
    suggests redactions to make the document unclassified. Security
    classification guidance from more than one guide at a time is figured into
    each suggested redaction. The probabilistic aspect of operation is in the
    way the system prioritizes its suggestions according to the measured rate
    of occurrence of words and phrases observed in the language's current
    usage, avoiding low likelihood phrases in favor of more probable
    interpretations. Collocation correlation of phrases in security
    classification guides has automatically discovered missing, incomplete, and
    inconsistent rules in existing security classification guides, promoting
    forward quality improvement of security classification guides. Performance
    from the earliest prototype software, implemented in Perl using associative
    arrays, was surprisingly acceptable and suggests that an alternative
    network representation, to be implemented using the map-reduce algorithm on
    a high performance cluster, would have improved capacity, depth, accuracy,
    and speed.},

	abstract = {Iridescent feather colors involved in displays of many extant
    birds are produced by nanoscale arrays of melanin-containing organelles
    (melanosomes). Data relevant to the evolution of these colors and the
    properties of melanosomes involved in their generation have been limited. A
    data set sampling variables of extant avian melanosomes reveals that those
    forming most iridescent arrays are distinctly narrow. Quantitative
    comparison of these data with melanosome imprints densely sampled from a
    previously unknown specimen of the Early Cretaceous feathered
    \emph{Microraptor} predicts that its plumage was predominantly iridescent.
    The capacity for simple iridescent arrays is thus minimally inferred in
    paravian dinosaurs. This finding and estimation of \emph{Microraptor}
    feathering consistent with an ornamental function for the tail suggest a
    centrality for signaling in early evolution of plumage and feather color.}

      has the ambition to be a global standard for IT-security certification.
      The issued certifications are mutually recognized between the signatories
      of the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement. The key element of mutual
      relationships is trust. A question raised in this paper is how far trust
      can be maintained in Common Criteria when additional signatories enter
      with conflicting geopolitical interests to earlier signatories. Other
      issues raised are control over production, the lack of permanent
      organization in the Common Criteria, which leads to concerns of being
      able to oversee the actual compliance. As Common Criteria is formulated
      today it is unlikely that it would survive over time. The reasons why it
      might fail is the rigid framework, rapid technical development makes a
      security target a moving target leading to instability and uncertainty,
      and the increased militarization in cyberspace moving from information
      assurance to information operations.},

	abstract = {Shannon was astonished when he discovered that his newly
    discovered measurement of information and the well-known physics concept of
    entropy were described by the same equations. It takes $kT\log2$ joules of
    energy to flip a bit; it cannot be done in less than $h\over 4E$ seconds,
    where $E$ is the energy we're willing to spend on the bit flip. To
    brute-force a 128 bit key requires destroying about 64 bits of information
    per round; if it were otherwise, clever cryptographers would frustrate
    brute-forcers by choosing keys near the upper end of the range. Conclusion:
    it takes $10^{17}$ joules to brute-force a 128-bit key, equivalent to a
    hundred 1 megatonne nuclear bombs. Doing it with that little power would
    take $10^{16}$ seconds, or about a billion years. NSA cannot be
    brute-forcing 128-bit keys, no matter what paranoids think. This is simple

    CLOAK system automatically flags candidate words, phrases, sentences, and
    paragraphs in documents under review that are likely classified and
    suggests redactions to make the document unclassified. Security
    classification guidance from more than one guide at a time is figured into
    each suggested redaction. The probabilistic aspect of operation is in the
    way the system prioritizes its suggestions according to the measured rate
    of occurrence of words and phrases observed in the language's current
    usage, avoiding low likelihood phrases in favor of more probable
    interpretations. Collocation correlation of phrases in security
    classification guides has automatically discovered missing, incomplete, and
    inconsistent rules in existing security classification guides, promoting
    forward quality improvement of security classification guides. Performance
    from the earliest prototype software, implemented in Perl using associative
    arrays, was surprisingly acceptable and suggests that an alternative

    important topics in cryptography. It aims to address a practical security
    problem: how to establish secure communication between two parties solely
    based on a shared password without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI). After more than a decade of extensive research in this field, there
    have been several PAKE protocols available. The EKE and SPEKE schemes are
    perhaps the two most notable examples. Both techniques are however
    patented. In this paper, we review these techniques in detail and summarize
    various theoretical and practical weaknesses. In addition, we present a new
    PAKE solution called J-PAKE. Our strategy is to depend on well-established
    primitives such as the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). So far, almost all of
    the past solutions have avoided using ZKP for the concern on efficiency. We
    demonstrate how to effectively integrate the ZKP into the protocol design
    and meanwhile achieve good efficiency. Our protocol has comparable
    computational efficiency to the EKE and SPEKE schemes with clear advantages
    on security.},

    would constitute cyber war: a potentially lethal, instrumental, and

    shows what cyber war is not, case-by-case. Not one single cyber offense on
    record constitutes an act of war on its own. The final part offers a more

    sensitive information. A principal security concern for systems permitting
    information release is whether this release is safe: is it possible that
    the attacker compromises the information release mechanism and extracts
    more secret information than intended? While the security community has
    recognised the importance of the problem, the state-of-the-art in
    information release is, unfortunately, a number of approaches with somewhat
    unconnected semantic goals. We provide a road map of the main directions of
    current research, by classifying the basic goals according to what
    information is released, who releases information, where in the system
    information is released and when information can be released. With a
    general declassification framework as a long-term goal, we identify some
    prudent principles of declassification. These principles shed light on
    existing definitions and may also serve as useful `sanity checks' for
    emerging models.},

    to resolve type errors in security-typed programs, enabling legacy code to
    be retrofit with comprehensive security policy mediation. Resolving such
    type errors requires selecting a placement of \emph{mediation statements}
    that implement runtime security decisions, such as declassifiers and
    authorization checks. Manually placing mediation statements in legacy code
    can be difficult, as there may be several, interacting type errors. In this
    paper, we solve this problem by constructing a graph that has the property
    that a vertex cut is equivalent to the points at which mediation statements
    can be inserted to allow the program to satisfy the type system. We build a
    framework that produces \emph{suggestions} that are minimum cuts of this
    graph, and the framework can be customized to find suggestions that satisfy
    programmer requirements. Our framework implementation for Java programs
    computes suggestions for 20,000 line programs in less than 100 seconds,
    reduces the number of locations a programmer must consider by 90\%, and
    selects suggestions similar to those proposed by expert programmers 80\% of
    the time.},

		Tortoise {\it Geochelone carbonaria}},
	author = {Anna Wilkinson and Natalie Sebanz and Isabella Mandl and Ludwig Huber},
	journal = {Current Zoology},
	volume = 57,
	number = 4,
	year = 2011,
	pages = {477--84},
	abstract = {Three hypotheses have attempted to explain the phenomenon of
    contagious yawning. It has been hypothesized that it is a fixed action
    pattern for which the releasing stimulus is the observation of another
    yawn, that it is the result of non-conscious mimicry emerging through close
    links between perception and action or that it is the result of empathy,
    involving the ability to engage in mental state attribution. This set of
    experiments sought to distinguish between these hypotheses by examining
    contagious yawning in a species that is unlikely to show nonconscious
    mimicry and empathy but does respond to social stimuli: the red-footed
    tortoise Geochelone carbonaria. A demonstrator tortoise was conditioned to
    yawn when presented with a red square-shaped stimulus. Observer tortoises
    were exposed to three conditions: observation of conditioned yawn, non
    demonstration control, and stimulus only control. We measured the number of
    yawns for each observer animal in each condition. There was no difference
    between conditions. Experiment 2 therefore increased the number of
    conditioned yawns presented. Again, there was no significant difference
    between conditions. It seemed plausible that the tortoises did not view the
    conditioned yawn as a real yawn and therefore a final experiment was run
    using video recorded stimuli. The observer tortoises were presented with
    three conditions: real yawn, conditioned yawns and empty background. Again
    there was no significant difference between conditions. We therefore
    conclude that the red-footed tortoise does not yawn in response to

	abstract = {In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires
    a statistical test on their difference. In practice, this comparison is
    often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which
    researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant ($P
    < 0.05$) but the other is not ($P > 0.05$). We reviewed 513 behavioral,
    systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals
    (\emph{Science}, \emph{Nature}, \emph{Nature Neuroscience}, \emph{Neuron},
    and \emph{The Journal of Neuroscience}) and found that 78 used the correct
    procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis
    suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in
    cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the
    erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling.},

    presented. The results of several tests of plexiglas windows are presented
    and discussed. It is concluded that the lapping of windows into their seats
    is unnecessary and that close fit is also not required. The ALVIN windows
    are conservative in design for an operating depth of 6000 feet. The use of
    a test window seat which does not simulate the hull strains is satisfactory
    for window test. It is recommended that the conical window seat be extended
    inward beyond the window to allow for normal elastic extrusion. Plexiglas
    windows are susceptible to collision damage due to brittleness and low
    strength of the material. An external rubber gasket was required to prevent
    low pressure leakage. (Author)},

	abstract = {We have predicted and observed an optical
		analogue of aerodynamic lift, in which a cambered
		refractive object with differently shaped top and
		bottom surfaces experiences a transverse lift force
		when placed in a uniform stream of light. A
		semi-cylindrical rod is found to automatically
		torque into a stable angle of attack, and then
		exhibit uniform motion. We have experimentally
		verified this using a micrometer-scale lightfoil
		which was fabricated using photolithographic
		techniques, immersed in water and illuminated with
		milliwatt-scale laser light. Unlike optical tweezers,
		an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a
		transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted
		simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of
		light. We propose using optical lift to power
		micromachines, transport microscopic particles in
		a liquid, or to improve the design of solar sails
		for interstellar space travel.

		in recent years. Moreover, smartphones are often used
		for privacy-sensitive tasks, becoming highly valuable
		targets for attackers. They are also quite different
		from PCs, so that PC-oriented solutions are not always
		applicable, or do not offer comprehensive security. We
		propose an alternative solution, where security checks
		are applied on remote \emph{security servers} that
		host exact \emph{replicas} of the phones in virtual
		environments. The servers are not subject to the
		same constraints, allowing us to apply \emph{multiple}
		detection techniques \emph{simultaneously}. We implemented
		a prototype of this security model for Android phones, and
		show that it is both practical and scalable: we generate
		no more than 2KiB/s and 64B/s of trace data for high-loads
		and idle operation respectively, and are able to support
		more than a hundred replicas running on a single server.

		One way of using scenarios to bridge security and usability
		involves explicitly describing how design decisions can lead

		Cases: scenarios which describe how design decisions may lead
		to usability problems subsequently leading to system misuse.
		We describe the related work motivating the design of the

		illustrating its application using a case study example.
		Finally, we describe some findings from this approach, which
		further inform the design of usable and secure systems.},

	abstract = {Side channel attacks on cryptographic systems are
		attacks exploiting information gained from physical
		implementations rather than utilizing theoretical
		weaknesses of a scheme. In particular, during the last
		years, major achievements were made for the class of
		access-driven cache-attacks. The source of information
		leakage for such attacks are the locations of memory
		accesses performed by a victim process.

		In this paper we analyze the case of AES and present an
		attack which is capable of recovering the full secret key
		in almost realtime for AES-128, requiring only a very
		limited number of observed encryptions. Unlike most other
		attacks, ours neither needs to know the ciphertext, nor
		does it need to know any information about the plaintext
		(such as its distribution, etc.). Moreover, for the first
		time we also show how the plaintext can be recovered
		without having access to the ciphertext. Further, our
		spy process can be run under an unprivileged user account.
		It is the first working attack for implementations using
		compressed tables, where it is not possible to find
		out the beginning of AES rounds any more -- a corner
		stone for all efficient previous attacks. All results
		of our attack have been demonstrated by a fully working
		implementation, and do not solely rely on theoretical
		considerations or simulations.

		A contribution of probably independent interest is a denial
		of service attack on the scheduler of current Linux
		systems (CFS), which allows to monitor memory accesses
		with novelly high precision. Finally, we give some
		generalizations of our attack, and suggest some possible
		countermeasures which would render our attack impossible.

	abstract = {This paper examines the limits of accuracy in reporting
		isolated product yields (i.e., recovery of total mass from chromatography
		or extractions) as well as ratios of isomers determined by HPLC,
		GC, or NMR methods. Attention is directed to the magnitude of errors
		encountered in the HPLC or GC measurements of such ratios when these
		measurements are conducted without accurate calibrations or determinations
		of response factors for the particular isomers. Accurately defined
		mixtures of compounds (prepared by volumetric means) were examined
		by the above methods and the obtained measurements compared with the
		actual composition. The relative errors between actual content and the
		measured values are listed for all comparisons. In addition, accuracy
		in the determination of weight of a sample as a function of scale was
		also examined. The results are tabulated for comparison and suggestions
		are made to the reader as to how to avoid inaccurate reporting of
		experimental parameters. The authors hope that disclosure of these facts
		will result in new editorial policies requiring that a phrase dr or er
		ratios reported in this paper have not been validated by calibration'
		be inserted into general experimental descriptions. In addition, such
		editorial policy should also discourage the use of terms de' and ee',
		as these descriptors do not provide accurate and meaningful information
		about stereoisomer composition. This latter issue has already been
		suggested in the literature on several occasions.},

		16.1\% of the prescriptions. Most (83.8\%) of the discrepancies could
		potentially lead to adverse events and many (16.8\%) to severe adverse
		events, involving a hospital admission or death. Discrepancies in doses,
		routes or complex regimens were most likely to have a potential for a
		severe event ($p=0.0001$). Discrepancies between structured and free-text
		fields in electronic prescriptions are common and can cause patient
		harm. Improvements in electronic medical record design are necessary to
		minimize the risk of discrepancies and resulting adverse events.},

    complicate the certification test and evaluation problem, because along
    with multiple data owners comes duplicate responsibility for residual
    risk. Over-reliance on independent verification and validation by
    certifiers and accreditors representing different government agencies is
    interpreted as conflating the principle of defence-in-depth with the
    practice of repeated verification and validation testing. Using
    real-world examples of successful and unsuccessful certification test and
    evaluation efforts to guide the development of a new communication tool
    for accreditors, this research aims to reduce time and cost wasted on
    unnecessary retesting of the same or similar security requirements during
    security test and evaluation in multi-level environments.},

	note = {URL: \URL{http://www.9iccc.kr/program/pdf/B2410.pdf}},
	abstract = {Few evaluations above EAL4; very few at EAL6 and EAL7; the new
    U.S.\ High Assurance Separation Kernel PP does not even correspond to an
    EAL at all; CC has not kept pace with technology; some automated formal
    analysis have become cheaper than semi-formal; there is an `abstraction
    gap' between the requirements placed on a TOE and the requirements placed
    on a PP especially at higher EALs (see graph) although the abstraction gap
    is present at all EALs; the authors propose goal-based assurance rather
    than standards-based assurance, as at present in the CC; proposed CC
    enhancements: EAL~X; they want to close the abstraction gap between TOE and
    PP at EAL~X by requiring more formality in the PP.},

		We conclude that trust is a dangerous word to use as it has
		manifold and sometimes contradictory meanings. There is no
		immediate problem when trust is used in a specific research area
		to denote some concept of interest. Difficulties arise when
		interfacing between communities that use this word differently,
		and with the general public which is unlikely to associate a word
		like trust with any specific technical definition adopted in a
		field of research.

        been discovered. LED status indicators on data communication
        equipment, under certain conditions, are shown to carry a modulated
        optical signal that is significantly correlated with information
        being processed by the device. Physical access is not required; the
        attacker gains access to all data going through the device, including
        plaintext in the case of data encryption systems. Experiments show
        that it is possible to intercept data under realistic conditions at
        a considerable distance. Many different sorts of devices, including
        modems and Internet Protocol routers, were found to be vulnerable. A
        taxonomy of compromising optical emanations is developed, and design
        changes are described that will successfully block this kind of
        ``Optical Tempest'' attack.},
